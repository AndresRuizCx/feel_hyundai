This is the second dealership that I am dealing with, and it is equally as bad as the one in Delray Beach. I will never buy another genesis vehicle again because of the service departments that I have dealt with. The first time I had a problem with my flip in my trunk and it took him six months to order the part then when they ordered the part They never contacted me that the part came in. After several times calling a dealership to find out if the part came in,they sent it back. Then I had to wait another 3 weeks for that part. Now this recent time that I went, I asked to have my tires rotated and oil changed after they fixed the flap on the gas tank door that wouldn’t open.   my husband put chalk marks on the front 2 tires and I asked them if they were rotated them after 4 1/2 hours. I asked the young woman if they did the tires and she assured me that they did. When I checked the marks my husband put on the tires were still there. I’m so unhappy with this service.

During that process,  I recalled not having access to the features of GCS the last time I logged in.  I then asked if Genesis was looking to resolve this issue with a software or hardware fix and was given a very short answer of no.  No elaboration at all to help me understand why such a great service on such a great premium car, was taken away due to a cellular network change that Genesis didn't have an answer for.  Very disappointed that a software or hardware fix is not available to fix this issue.  Wireless carriers are always upgrading their network to provide better network services.

I have asked repeatedly for some  type of  documentation to note that and nothing.  Also taking around 2 month to be able to utilize the valet drop off and pick up is ridiculous, I drivea lt of miles and and oil changes com up quickly, so I don’t have the mileage cushion to utilize that service. Speaking of service I have never encountered a positive experience coming through service except for one time I get my car back with either something missing that was on there when it came in or just idiotic mistakes and sloppiness made by the dealership for instance right now. I’m currently driving around on the tire that was installed with the outside tread on the inside, it’s marked on the tire. They’re the only people that have dealt with my tires so I’m just baffled by that and wondering if it’s going to void the tire warranty of course trying to get a hold of anyone at the dealership is impossible. There are so many other instances I could talk about, but it’s just a moot point. It goes in one ear and out the other at the Dealership level and I’m frustrated beyond belief and if I could get rid of the car, I would you have a great product as far as the vehicle is concerned and getting a first time buyer , you’re never gonna have at least one service that it’s just ridiculous ",35732677,Low Score 2 & 3 Star Response,"",06/02/2024,06/02/2024,06/02/2024,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,31158542,,Brett,Jowell,,btjowell@verizon.net,,,,,,,2023,Genesis,G70,KMTG34TA3PU106125,15.181.199.182,de38,,15.181.199.182,'Mobile Safari 17.5','iOS 17.5.1',23365662,CA,2024/05/31 07:14:43,2024/05/31 07:30:14,Service Link,Schedule Maintenance,GCCC Care,GCCC Care,31158542,28383692,,34430,JACQUELIN.MAYBELLOVE,,,,Y, GENESIS BRAND - GCS SERVICE LINK ASSISTANCE need to schedule routine maintenance with valet and loaner,OWNER REFUSED APPOINTMENT FOR VALET AND LOANER FOR MID JULY WITH GENESIS OF IRVING.

,,,Micheal Hines,06/07/2024,n/a,1,1,2,2,1,1,8,"The representitive I spoke with was really awful.  Although he acted as though he was being helpful he lack of actual knowledge and overall attiture was terrible.  My question was a sime one.  How do you put the tire pressure pictogram back on the instrument cluster after it somehow was removed?  Any of your reps should know the answer to that right away and not have to fumble around for probably 15 minutes to figure out the answer.  When I did what he was telling me and it didn't work I said I'll let you go and please call me back when you figure it out.  The I suggested that he call a dealership where they probably get this question occasionally.  He then rudely siad that I should try calling a dealership to do the same.  I told him to please try and get back to me with why the solution he suggested left me with no tire pressure monitor.  My wife and I are elderly and live in the heat of South Florida and bought a car that does not come with a spare tire.  Therefore it's extremely important to alway know the status of the tire's pressure.  He didn't care and I knew he would never get back to me.  I would fire someone like that if they worked in my organization.  I have owned many new BMW's a couple of new Porsche's and a Mercedes-Benz and several VW's.  Despite their high prices the phone centers are all way better than Genesis', even VW is better than the Genesis Connected.  I have had several encounters with you folks and have been disappointed most times.  I like the car very much but as for competing on the service level with the German brands you are miles behind them.  
Thank you,
Michael Hines
