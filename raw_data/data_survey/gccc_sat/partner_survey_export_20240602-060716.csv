Corrected most of the problem but was difficult to hear and somewhat difficult to understand.  The navigation street identification problem is better but still hard to read the cross streets on the screen as you approach them.  It was much clearer prior.  When in the basic MAP mood street names would appear as you drove toward them.  Now the appear but are hard to read while driving.  Overall we are enjoying the quality of our GV 70.

My other concern was that Electrify America, whom Genesis contracted with for 3 years of free charging for my Electrified G80, won’t honor the promotion, saying my promo code (the engine code for my car) has already been used. EA has horrible customer care and a 1.5 out of 5 rating, and I have contacted them 4 times about the free charging, gotten conflicting answers, and never been called back by a supervisor despite a promise to. When I turned to Genesis for assistance, I was told it was a dealer issue, not a Genesis issue.
This is my third Genesis (2015 Equus, traded for a new 2019 G90, and now the new Electrified G80); you folks contracted with EA, not the dealer. If you want to keep former Mercedes buyers (like me, I had 3 of those) and other luxury brand consumers, you have to deliver that level of post purchase customer service.

I own a GV 80 purchased in Fort Wayne Indiana. Juan was very nice thank you. However we do not have a genesis dealership in Fort Wayne any more. Furthermore I feel that we the end user takes it on the chin…….for the mistakes or reasons why Fort Wayne is gone. Now I would think that Genesis would be doing there best to make things right as it’s not my fault why that dealership was lost. I am forced to look at your competitors who are rolling up there sleeves to win over your existing customers. So with my experience in Fort Wayne to put it quite frankly…..it was less than good. Now what should I do? I tried calling, emailing just to communicate my thoughts and concerns only to fall on deaf ears. Please be assured of my point of view and the shoulders I rub day to day!

But as Genesis doesn't have a Dealership in El Paso, TX anymore; so, Ashley promised to call me back next day, and to inform me about the arrangement that she will make with the Genesis Dealership in Arizona, to send a Truck and take my SUV to be fixed. 
So far, Ashely didn't call and my SUV still leaking I don't know what kind of liquid. Genesis was informed and send a Text message informing me about the leak, but no one has acted so far to provide a service that is under warranty. I do assure you that if by next Monday Genesis does not provide any convenient solution, I will ask my Lawyer to take care of this and other issues that my SUV has, which was never repaired by your local Ex-Dealership.  my GV80 has 28,000 miles approximately.

GA715,45709,Genesis Of Kennesaw,Bart Malencia,05/12/2024,n/a,3,5,5,3,2,5,1,"Ciara was great!!  But due to how Genesis runs it's business, there was nothing she could do.  She was able to add clarity to my question about a recent recall of my 2020 G70.  As per Ciara, it's up to the local retailer to determine their processes and how they treat customers.  The issue is the dealer won't order the part, though it's well know as my car is part of the safety recall, until they have the car in hand.  The dealer stated that I have to drop it off and it will be 3 or 4 days until I get it back.  Yes, they are going to give me a loaner for the duration.  But that's not the point.  What should be able to be resolved in one day / one visit to the dealer across town will now take 2 visits.  

My wife is on her third Lexus.  I've had Audis, BMWs, and Mercedes cars.  I would compare the Genesis vehicles, mine included, to the other luxury providers.  Comparatively though, Genesis service is Chevy / Kia level at best.  Until Genesis has the dealer network treat customers at the scale of other luxury providers, Genesis will be a second-tier provider that has to keep discounting cars to compete.  

I hope you forward this to executive management of Genesis USA and they take appropriate action.  I'm going to be due for a new car soon.  I'd like to really consider a Genesis.  But an abysmal service experience for a luxury brand will ensure I choice another brand.

Please feel free to contact me if someone in management would like to discuss.

No matter where the POI I wanted was located (several places in Michigan), the website only returned places with similar names near Cupertino, CA. Even putting in the full address from Google Maps didn't change the outcome. Fortunately, when I tried the website search the next day before the trip it had been fixed and I was able to send meaningful addresses to my car.  While Paul may not have been able to help me due to confusion about the problem, I really appreciating his attempt to contact me in person via the phone. Kudos!!

I have treated the vehicle with the care as needed, and drive it in a well managed way. 2 weeks ago a strange knocking sound came to light. I had a third party mechanic investigate the noise, they said the engine has a blown rod. I contacted the dealer, they informed me it’s out of warranty because I was not the original owner, this is very discouraging. Now I have a bill of goods because the manufacturer is not backing their product as sold. I admire the vehicle, and sure wish the manufacturer would honor a good will claim.
