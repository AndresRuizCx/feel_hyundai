CA711,45737,Genesis Of Escondido,Gerry Akin,01/05/2024,n/a,1,5,5,5,5,1,10,"I want to provide some hopefully helpful criticism regarding your rideshare reimbursement process. I used a rideshare December 5, 2023 to return to the dealer to pick up my Genesis G80. I appreciate your offer to reimburse me for that cost, and just today, January 5 2024, exactly one month later, I believe the reimbursement was made. I will know for sure when I see it in my bank statement, probably tomorrow. My displeasure with this process is that it is excessively bureaucratic, time consuming, and unworthy of the Genesis brand. 
Everything else about my Genesis experience, since 2011 when I bought my first Genesis, has been positive and impressive, consistently providing me excellent value for my money.  I don't know how much text I can include in this feedback, but I will keep going until it no longer allows me to type, or I am done. 
Genesis Customer Care Case #: 22392959
To process my refund I was instructed to send copies of my ownership document, driver's license, and Uber receipt.  After multiple attempts I was unable to upload the uber receipt (PDF) into your on-line system. My DL and the ownership docs, also PDFs, uploaded fine, but the Uber PDF would not load, no matter what I did. Your customer care representatives were very helpful and assisted me several times. Ultimately, they provided me with an email and I replied to that email with the Uber receipt attached. That worked. So, I expected my work (about 2 hours) was finished.  This was December 13, 2023. Already too much effort and frustration for a $35 refund. And already a negative experience, not befitting the Genesis brand. 

December 14, 2023 I received another email, telling me my submission was incomplete. I needed to send additional information as follows:
 ""Thank you for contacting Genesis Customer Care, because we value you as part of our Genesis family, we would like to review your request for assistance. We have received your proof of ownership, and your UBER receipt, however, we require some additional information to proceed with your request. So that we may further review this request in detail, please respond to this email with the following documents: - Repair Order: complete and legible with Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and mileage clearly shown. - Proof of Payment: cancelled check, bank statement, credit card receipt, or credit card statement reflecting payment. Please black out all account numbers and other sensitive information. This must be different than the UBER receipt.""

More documentation, much of which seems to be redundant. But more importantly, why was I not instructed to send these additional documents in the original request?  After another 45 minutes or so of my time, I assembled and sent these added docs. Understand I did not follow through with this additional request because I needed the $35. By then I was more interested in seeing just how much time and expense (my time and your time as well) Genesis Customer Care would require to finish this transaction. 
December 27, I was informed via email that my e-payment was being processed, and I should stand by for further notification, likely from Chase Bank.
Today January 5, 2024 I received an email from Hyundai Motor America and processing instructions via J.P Morgan Chase. I completed those instructions and was told the e-payment was sent to my account. I probably won't see it today, tomorrow is Saturday, so if not tomorrow, maybe Monday. I don't care which day it is, I would like to be able to confirm I actually received it, but I am at my bank's mercy for that.

Summary:
I realize you are applying some stringent accounting policies to these requests. Are they all necessary? Example - I not only submitted the uber receipt but a record of payment from my bank. Are both necessary?
To fix this, I see simple solutions. The best one would be to work with the dealership and provide a ride share both ways, when, as in my case, a loaner was not available. Genesis of Escondido has a mileage restriction, round trip rideshare to my home exceeds the mileage restriction, so they only offer one way for me. Genesis of Escondido is the closest Genesis dealer to my home, so my other choices are worse. Perhaps you can work with Genesis of Escondido to fix this?
Or, another solution is to streamline the reimbursement process, hopefully with fewer documents, and make sure to explain all the document requirements up front. 
Lastly - fix the online site that accepted my DL and ownership documentation, but absolutely refused to upload the Uber receipt. Even trying to send the Uber receipt all by itself with no other docs, did not work. I found that to be pretty frustrating, and I am not a computer novice. I routinely perform all my own phone, PC and network maintenance. Your upload site had me baffled by not accepting the Uber PDF. 
I am open to hearing more from someone at Genesis about this, and I hope you can find ways to improve this process and restore my complete confidence in the Genesis brand.

I tried the local dealer's service department, but there I was referred to the sales dept, then told to call Genesis National. I did so, got a recording, left a message for a call back, and it's been three days but not call back. I was calling a number for Genesis HQ found online. So, having bought my first Genesis in 2009 when it was from the Hyundai dealer, I looked up the number for Hyundai online, called it, and was lucky enough to reach Vanessa. My issue concerned my receiving message that my 2024 Genesis 80 was due for service--since I've owned it five weeks and it has under 900 miles, I suspected this was an error, but of course, one never knows if the computer has detected that one of the wheels is about to fall off. It is a real shame that the local dealer was not able to reassure me, nor that the Genesis national number was unresponsive. Fortunately the Hyundai national number was maned by a competent person. You can bet that I've saved that number.

,,,Edward James,01/06/2024,n/a,1,5,5,1,1,1,0,"Monica was very courteous and pleasant, nothing wrong with her.  I have a 2012 Genesis 4.6 sedan.  I called Hyundai originally and was transferred to Genesis. Hyundai said they could not help me. Monica told me that I have to go back to Hyundai because it's a 2012, I guess it's not a ""real"" Genesis. So back I go to Hyundai and they couldn't help me after all. The fact that Hyundai can't help me is very disappointing. I am looking for an ECU for my 2012 Hyundai Genesis, part #391103F280. I was told that you don't have the capability of searching dealer inventory or any other inventory for that matter and I should just start calling dealerships to see if they have the part in stock. That's no help. I originally took my vehicle to our local dealer, Wallace Hyundai/Genesis in Stuart, Florida.  It took me 10 weeks to get my car into service! This is not acceptable. After spending over $3,000 my car still has the same problem. Now it's the ECU, maybe, no guarantee. That is horrible service both from the dealer and Hyundai USA.  My wife has a Mercedes and when she had to take in her car about the same time as I needed service on my car, the Mercedes dealer asked if the next day is acceptable. That's called customer service. I had to wait 10 weeks! I am in the market for a new car. To replace my car with a comparable Genesis G80 I would have to spend $85,000.  I will not purchase another Genesis after this disaster. I love my current car, great car, that's why I still have it and that you no longer offer a V8. I'm currently looking into purchasing a Mercedes.

I could take my 2023 GV80 to the dealer for the required software update which is over an hour and a half drive, or I could download the update onto my computer, transfer the update to a thumb drive and then install the update in the GV80. The dealer update option would basically take an entire day of my time…..3 hours of driving plus the time at the dealer. The do it yourself update required that I purchase a USB adapter ($45) for my MacBook Air and a 64gig thumb drive ($20) so that I could accomplish the download, transfer and update in the vehicle. I chose the latter since I didn’t want to waste an entire day with the dealer option.
I completed the update but found the entire process inconvenient, cumbersome and expensive. My Acura that I traded in on my GV80 was able to accomplish this type of update by simply selecting Update on the infotainment system in the car……very easy, convenient and no cost.

Then the service manager Darren reached out as well which is greatly appreciated, and lastly Genesis reached to make sure I was satisfied.  The level of service you receive from Genesis as a company and the Genesis Dealership in Weatherford is top notch! Highly recommend not only the dealership but Genesis!

Genesis makes it beyond cumbersome to turn the feature on and I wanted to understand WHY?  There are two ways one can turn it on.  Neither are user friendly in any way.  I finally was informed via email it is working as designed and is done this to prevent unintentional use of data.  OK.  But I'm the customer.  And as the customer, I'm going to paying for service.  So making it hard to even use is simply not user friendly.  So un-user friendly that I will NOT be continuing the Hotspot service when my 3 month trial ends.  

I participate on several Genesis forums.  No one who has commented on this service has suggested they will pay for it either.  It's unfortunate Genesis has chosen this path as having Hotspot service in car, can be useful.  I suspect the adoption rate will be very poor as a result of the poor implementation.

The issue seems to be not corrected.  Since the service department was closed no one could illustrate that the issue has been corrected.  I have just accepted that the fingerprint option is not available to me.  I would like to stress I own or lease five cars.  Three of them are Hyundai/Kia Products. (Kia Carnival, Hyundai Santa Fe calligraphy and the Genesis GV70.    The Kia dealer (not related to the Genesis Dealer) has been great which is why I decided to purchase the Genesis product.  I have owned every premium brand automobile from Audi to Mercedes. (currently I have a BMW M850 and a Lincoln Aviator)  Genesis  comes in a far distant last place.   I am confused on how a dealer can order a part to repair the issue, two months later call me and tell me they have the part, give me a loaner and then 24 hours later when I inquired the status of the repair to tell me they did not have the part.  I was then informed that the part would come in January.  I attempted to contact the dealer and did not get a response to my call and text.  It is only because I contacted Genesis of USA and got a case number 22613670 did the dealer contact me (my opinion).   It seems to me that Hyundai is not meant to have a premium brand.

,,,Venkatesh Iyer,01/17/2024,n/a,5,5,5,5,5,3,0,"I want to state that the Genesis car experience as well as help from Clare have been great: I literally have no complaints.

But the overall handover to the dealership - Genesis of San Bruno - is not just sub-par compared to your competitors, it absolutely obliterated my trust in your brand.

This particular dealership is absolutely the worst I have dealt in, and you should have records dating back to 2023 detailing my dismal experience with them.

From a lack of promised call-backs, to basics like Valet Service being unavailable unless the appointment is made ahead of time, to missing warranty part orders (this is from a prior negative experience in 2023), literally every aspect of the post-sales experience screams “Buy a Genesis, Get treated worse than a Kia Buyer.” 

I personally have told five friends and colleagues in the market, who were excited about your amazing cars and terrific value to steer clear from Genesis. Not sure anyone in the executive chain at Genesis or North America cares enough about what your customers are saying either (check out the Facebook Genesis user groups to get a sense for how bad things are).",34654097,"","",01/14/2024,01/17/2024,01/17/2024,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,23861764,,Venkatesh,Iyer,,venkatesh.iyer@gmail.com,,,,,,,2023,Genesis,GV60,KMUKEDTB5PU009811,45.62.187.76,fafb,,45.62.187.76,'Mobile Safari 17.2','iOS 17.2.1',22459149,CA,2023/12/10 22:18:50,2024/01/12 05:18:24,Service Link,Schedule Maintenance,HMA General Superuser,GCCC Care,23861764,25543826,,10496,CIARA.BARNETT,Western Region,Genesis Western District 1,CA743,Y, UNABLE TO ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH GENESIS RETAILER VALET; the owner wants to confirm the appointment was made for valet they didn't get confirmation  GENESIS BRAND - GCS SERVICE LINK ASSISTAN,"Scheduled dealership appointment at Genesis Of San Bruno 01/11/2024 8:30 am valet with loaner   NO ANSWER WHEN I CALLED, VOICEMAIL LEFT",CIARA,Y

FL701,45616,Rick Case Genesis,David Tomen,01/18/2024,n/a,5,5,2,5,5,2,10,"This was NOT Tatiana's fault. But the problem is with your app developer. I frequently use the Valet function on the dashboard of my GV80 which I love. I have never used the related Valet Mode setting in the Android app but understand its function.

The function that needs to be eliminated from the Android App is the Vehicle Safeguard Alert > Valet Alert. Because it is not related to activating Valet Mode and if accidently activated will continue sending alerts to my phone and email unless it is de-activated. If you intend to leave this function in the app then rename it to something like: Geo-Fence alert (which is already present).

Please eliminate Vehicle Safeguard Alert > Valet Alert because it is redundant and not needed. It only causes problems.

The first 2 - 3 technical support people I spoke with were unaware of this function. Tatiana was the first to spot it a month after I first filed my technical support request. Thank you Tatiana!

Thanks,
David

Please note our car was on the Genesis lot for over 5 hours on January 9. A couple of those hours just sitting in the lot waiting on the service center to give us a quote on body work. On January 16, they dropped off a loaner and told my wife to make sure she put gas back in it if she used it. I'm ok with that. However, when they dropped off her car the following day, it was empty. The gas light was on and the guy that dropped it off told us to put gas in it. This also occurred when it was about 5 degrees outside. For a luxury brand employee to drive a car on empty in 5 degree weather seems unacceptable. If we had to put gas in the loaner car, wouldn't it be the same for Genesis to put gas in our car? 
I was not happy. The dealership is about 40 minutes away one way. My wife's car was about a quarter tank when they took it. 
So for them not to put fuel in it (at least what they used), after my wife was instructed to do it for loaner car, is not cool at all. Not to mention the extra 40 miles each way that was put on her car because the navigation update wasn't completed during the initial visit. 

We love the car but I'm getting very frustrated with the service center and customer service after we bought it.

,,,Ted Farmer,01/18/2024,n/a,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,"Austen was very nice and as helpful as he could be.  I recently completed my second Genesis lease.  I first leased a G80, then a G70.   You are making great products.  A few months after my G70 lease ended, you turned off my Connected Services.  This was after I paid the lease residual and kept the car, so I just paid you another $26,000. Austen kindly offered to sell me continued Connected Services at a discounted price, but I didn't want to pay for that on principle.  I note that you just rolled out lifetime Connected Services for customers buying a 2023 or newer product.  So I was a repeat customer, paid you handsomely, and Genesis seems deaf to all of that.  Maybe Genesis is doing well enough without me.
I will also complain that during COVID, your Concierge Services disappeared.  No door-to-door pickup for service of my car, and no Genesis car given to me while you serviced my car. Heck, for my last routine service, the dealerships had no loaners at all, Genesis, Hyundai, Kia, or otherwise.  I dutifully paid my lease payments and performed my lease despite not getting all that I was paying for each month.
I was also very surprised that during the last six months of my recent lease, I didn't get a single call from anybody in sales or marketing, at Genesis or any dealership, trying to get me into a new vehicle.  Especially surprising given that I was a repeat customer.   You're missing the sweet spot on developing brand loyalty.  I am self-employed as a service provider.

I appreciate you getting back to me
I do have another issue that happened last week

Due to the lack of the service center not being able to download the new updates on my wife's new GV70

They had to reschedule and come out get her car
They dropped off a loaner and told her to make sure she put gas back in it to return it where she got it
I'm ok with that
But when they dropped off her car it was on empty

I was not happy
The dealership is about 40 minutes away one way

My wife's car was under halfway when they took it
So for them not to put fuel in it ( at least what they used)
After my wife was instructed to do it for loaner car

Is not cool at all

We love the car but I'm getting very frustrated with the service center and service after we bought it

,,,Bibi Hafeez,01/25/2024,n/a,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,"The experience with Genesis Customer Care was above average. They were courteous, professional and they really try and do the best they can for the customer. The problem lies with the dealership Mahwah Genesis. They have been unresponsive and difficult to reach.  Phone calls left are not returned and sometimes it can be frustrating to get in touch with a live person. And this has been the experience of many Genesis owners. A quick search on genesis GV forums online will also fully support the above statements. This dismal experience is not unique to Mahwah Genesis. Other dealers around the country are not providing the necessary customer service needed to support Genesis owners and their investment in the brand.
As a result, owners may eventually leave the brand altogether for brands that takes customer service seriously and demonstrates that they put their customers first. Simple things like an appointment for an oil change should not take 2 weeks to make. And why should it have to be made 4 months in advance? Yes, I had to call to Genesis Customer care to help me make an appointment at the Mahawah Genesis dealership. And even they had trouble making the appointment. It took so long that I was provided a case number to keep as my record to follow up.
And since I am writing this, Mahwah dealership tried to bamboozle me on the purchase price of the vehicle. My 2024 GV70 3.5 T sport advanced, sport prestige matted green with ivory interior, Genesis Mahwah tried to upcharge me over three thousand five hundred above MSRP. After arriving home and looking over the paperwork, I realized the overcharge and went back the next day and contested that “agreed upon price.”
They tried to convince me that there is nothing that can be done about the price until I showed them the negotiated MSRP that was provided to me in an email done in July 2023. The vehicle was delivered on October 13 2023. At this point in time the office manager intervened and agreed to honor the agreed upon price which came up to be around 500.00 over MSRP.
This type of experience is what sours buyers on a brand.

The app won't work and my workplace sits on a hill in an open area, I can hardly ever get my car started before going out.  I've tried everything.  I also have numerous electrical issues (volume is dysfunctional on radio (steering wheel works), trunk latch sometimes opens, sometimes opens halfway, sometimes never opens, the rear driver door doesn't open when all the others do), the Genesis dealership is no longer in business in my area.  The nearest is Kalamazoo, MI - 2 hrs from me and they're booked through the end of February.  The other closest are in Detroit and Chicago.  Three and half hours away from me.  Most are only open Monday through Friday, so I need to take time off of work to take my car in for a maintenance check!  I also believe they will need it for longer than one day, but they are all so busy that I can't get good information from any of the dealerships as to how they handle issues like mine when I'm driving across state.  I am beside myself with what to do!  I have even thought that I could take it to a Hyundai dealership, and even though it will likely VOID MY WARRANTY, none of them will work on it.  So I have no real options here.  Any help from Genesis would be helpful, but geez, I'm overwhelmed with my situation.  I love the drive, it's a beautiful and quiet vehicle.  It handles dreamily in the snow.  I love it, but I think I'm going to have to trade it in on some normal, regular, ordinary vehicle.  :/",34723095,Low Score 2 & 3 Star Response,"",01/23/2024,01/24/2024,01/24/2024,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,28916980,,Rebecca,Injerd,,rebecca.injerd@mcd911.net,,,,,,,2019,Genesis,G90,KMTF54JHXKU054314,172.87.33.194,5f1b,,172.87.33.194,'Firefox 121.0.','Windows 10',22657409,CA,2024/01/18 21:15:11,2024/01/21 10:52:28,Remote Services,Functionality Concerns,Siebel Administrator,Genesis Email,28916980,30550048,,35000,DUSTIN.CHEMERIKA,,,,Y,"REMOTE SERVICES TROUBLESHOOTING;  Continuing issues with remote start.

Also what car was “ready” It reaked of gasoline and all the windows were open. I was upset and went to the service manager. I was standing outside his office and someone was with him but he asked if I needed some help and told him I was upset about my visit and my car smelling of gas. He told me I was upset at the wrong person. He stated I should be upset at Genesis and as far as my wait I should have read the service bulletin. I did lose my temper and told him the hell with it and left. 
      I also saw a man who was in for service that was not treated properly by the service manager and refused to deal with him and two ladies helped him.
      I do enjoy my GV80  but i  have owned several luxury brands and never been treated like that by any service manager.

,,,Tim Landon,02/03/2024,n/a,4,5,5,3,3,3,1,"Sarah was very nice.  Unfortunately, when she called, she knew nothing about the issue I had written about (not her fault - see below).  When I explained it further, she told me that Genesis did not have any access to test 2024 Genesis G90s to see if the problem had been corrected from the 2023 G90s (the vehicle I have).  She said she was pretty sure that any issues would have been corrected, but if I wanted to find out for sure, I needed to go to a dealer who could take me to a 2024 G90 on their lot and I could run tests to see if the problem existed on the 2024 models like it does the 2023s. I have NO PROBLEM AT ALL with Sarah.  She was very nice and was doing all she could.  She had been to a manager to ask about the issue, and the manager apparently did not either have time or access (one of the two) to check into the defect with engineering.  The manager told her to tell me that the 2024 Genesis G90s do have SiriusXM (not my question - I was asking about Genesis deactivating the feature accidentally in October 2022 and seeing if the same defect rolled over to the 2024 G90s.)  I am very surprised that Genesis Corporate cannot tell me if a feature that every other car IN THE WORLD with Sirius XM has (except the 2023 G90s) is or is not available on the 2024 G90s.  I wish someone at Genesis could check on this for me without me having to drive to a dealership and ask them to provide me a 2024 G90 to see if the car has this feature.  ONCE AGAIN - SARAH WAS WONDERFUL AND REALLY WANTS TO HELP.  She just needs someone to provide her the support she needs to do it in this instance.  Lastly, my decision to not recommend Genesis to a friend has NOTHING to do with this case with Sarah.  It is much more about the capability of the dealerships to deliver on promises than the vehicles themselves.  (NOTE: Genesis of Plano, TX has been much more customer-centric with the new GM. He is the only reason I am considering buying another Genesis for our family.)  Thank you for your time and consideration.

,,,Joseph Corso,02/05/2024,n/a,5,5,5,4,4,4,10,"Kelly was wonderful.  My disappointment came with the email announcing my connected services were ending 3/31/24, which is a 1 1/2 months away and I never knew I had the connected services.  I don't drive that much anymore and after 3 years I've just last week reached 12,000 miles.  Kelly was the first person to explain how to use the connected services and I immediately regretted not being aware enough to use them in the past, because the Genesis Intelligent Assistance would have been very welcome.  Of course, I received what I thought was a thorough introduction to the vehicle 3 years ago, but after about 45 minutes I began to zone out.  I had your Equus for 8 years prior to the G90 so felt pretty comfortable with the car.  I received 3 manuals with the car and unfortunately I was never aware of the advantages available through connected services before Kelly explained them.  (She did a great job, but it's too late.)  
This G90 is, like the Equus before it, the best vehicle I've ever owned (which includes several Cadillacs and 2 Lexus sedans.  Your Genesis far outshines them and the BMW's, Mercedes, and other vehicles I've rented.  I just can't get over the fact that I wasn't able to take advantage of Intelligent Assistance until the end of my 3 year introduction, and as the only driver of this vehicle (and soon to be 82) I could certainly have used it over the last 12,000 miles, but can't see my self justifying $99/year for each of the services.  I've recommended the Genesis to others and have 2 friends have purchased one (one was a G90 & the other the new SUV) and both are thrilled with the car.  I'd be surprised if I ever own another car.",34817293,"","",02/05/2024,02/05/2024,02/05/2024,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,11570819,,Joseph,Corso,,pepcorso@gmail.com,,,,,,,2021,Genesis,G90,KMTF54PH0MU088210,71.90.106.237,14c0,,71.90.106.237,'Chrome 121.0.0.0','Windows 10',22735597,CA,2024/02/03 12:59:52,2024/02/03 13:24:37,Product Information,General,GCCC Care,GCCC Care,11570819,12561421,,,KELLY.RICHARD,,,,Y,"GCS [BILLING/SUBSCRIPTION] ASSISTANCE - GCS FEATURES- What packages are with the Connected services?, What would would it cost to keep the subscription","educated owner about GCS trail, went over detailed information about packages, mobile app, features and prices",KELLY,

I was disappointed when I was not notified by Genesis that the Goshen dealership (My purchase location.) had ended their connection with Genesis and was no longer servicing my car. I found this out when I called to schedule my first service appointment. I scheduled an appointment at the Danbury location, and lost my key fob right after scheduling the appointment. I called to order a replacement and  spoke with Brandon, who took care of the part order. I asked then to be transferred to Service in order to find out the cost of the part. The employee I spoke with told me it would be ""around""  $571.00 and would require a half hour of labor. I received a call from Brandon who told me the part was in, and I asked him to transfer me to Service so that I could get the exact figure. The person I spoke to gave me a price that was $ 100.00 higher than the price I had been quoted earlier. He stated that that the process required to connect the fob would involve an hour labor. I asked to speak to a manager in Service, and MAUREEN took my call, helping me resolve the issue. I realize that Service receives commission on the jobs they schedule, but I didn't appreciate being treated as if I wouldn't notice a $100.00  difference. It leaves me with a negative feel toward the dealership, and I haven't even set foot in the building yet. However, MAUREEN did all she could to turn the situation around. She is an asset to your dealership.

I was informed by the customer care rep that, that program had expired on Jan 2 ....... 9 days before I purchased my electrified GV70 and no future program was anticipated.   I then asked why my sales rep would have indicated that I would be eligible for the $500 assistance if the program had already expired, and no new programs were planned.

,,,Mary Absi,02/11/2024,n/a,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,"I called Metro West Dealership on 2/5/24 to make an appointment if possible that day due to a major blow out of my right front tire on a major mass pike highway. Customer care representative told me that there is no vehicles available till the end of February. I would have to wait till then!! I proceeded to explain to her that I am driving on a donut tire which have restrictions. Her poor customer service skills were so applauding. Her behavior, rudeness, and sharp tone turned me off from this dealership. I asked for a manager. Then I disconnected the call. How does this new company allow disrespected, unprofessional people work for a use to be “ well- known dealership”?! 
Jasmine from the Genesis customer service department called me back and asked my concerns. I told her the phone conversation with that girl, and how could that representative told me “the customer”  to wait three weeks and drive on a donut tire because they didn’t have any available rental cars to offer me and she did not verbally attempt to problem solve the situation… she just rudely told me to just wait! Who talks like this in
a professional arena to their customers?? My main question is who is hiring these incompetent people to work in a dealership that has well-known roof in that town?? I need to replace the hiring manager!!!
What kind of customer service is that? 
Jasmine put a plan in place asked me to come to the dealership and that she would ask a technician to stay a little later to give me a new tire. A major problem with half the staff is they do not listen to the customer. They are too much in a hurry to get to the task they don’t care. Customers will feel better if handled professionally and with kindness, and they will not come back to the dealership guaranteed. You will lose your customer base if you do not change the way people approach and resolve problems. The previous owners staff would make you feel like you were part of their family.  The new owner’s staff make you feel you are a number at the deli counter. A nice suit on the managers don’t make the business come to the door and stay! How you are approached in a positive genuine manner is key. 
Also, Doug made each customer feel special. He wanted to hear what you wanted and he would make it work to make a good deal for the customer and in turn it would be a win-win for the customer and the dealership! Management needs to take lessons! Change needs to happen, or the dealership will not survive. People feel the negative energy when they enter this Dealership.

Once he got involved, I was treated like a true VIP with a replacement vehicle and excellent service. The entire staff seemed to rise to the challenge and exceeded my expectations for repair. The second incident where I required a review of one aspect of my SUV, went as quickly and smoothly and professionally as possible. A gorgeous brand-new Hyundai Santa Fe with four-wheel drive was washed, with a full tank of gas and ready to go as soon as I arrived. The Ogden Service Manager, Amanda, was exceptional, and not only got the inspection done within 24-hours, but even supplied me with written instructions on another topic I had inquired

The technician and I tested it together. Android phones have no issue, apple phones do. He suggested I call Genesis Connected Services, which I did. Megan was very friendly and helpful. She told me this is a known issue and they are working on a fix. She told me the immediate fix is to keep the volume below 20, which does work. She did not know when this issue would be resolved. If Genesis knows about an issue it would be wise to share this information with your service centers. I would much rather have been told they cannot fix this at the dealer before I took a day off and wasted my time leaving my car there.

I was told by another representative that I need to do an upgrade of my navigation system. I cannot do the upgrade unless the navigation system manufacturers provide me with a USB which is going to cost me $25 or more. Since this is a Genesis issue, I don’t feel that I should have to pay for a repair to a navigation system that is not allowing Genesis connected services to access the modem in my vehicle. I am being charged monthly for services that I cannot use. One of the main reasons I purchased a Genesis was because of the name recognition and features in the vehicle. Over the course of the last two years this is the second issue that I’ve had with my vehicle that Genesis has been unable to resolve. This is very disappointing.

I called up ""Genesis Stevens Creek"" in California to schedule my first maintenance appointment on Monday this week. Because of incompetent handling by the dealership when they sold my car, I was told by the service center that my car is not eligible for complimentary maintenance. Over the last 5 days, I have submitted all the documents requested and yet, I don't have a resolution. Genesis is a premium brand - I honestly am shocked with the level of competency both with the dealership where I purchased my car and also Genesis Concierge in resolving this matter. Why wasn't the paperwork done correctly when I purchased my car? Why do I, as a customer have to run around contacting Concierge and the dealership over 8 phone calls this week to get my car into maintenance?

,,,Jonathan Sisk,02/16/2024,n/a,1,5,5,5,1,1,5,"The problem is NOT Vincent. It is your software update procedure. The first problem is that my car has been in for Genesis service twice and the SW was not updated. It should have been! I was told I have to ask for that? Delegating that responsibility to the customer is not consistent with a luxury brand experience. When I complained, I was sent an email telling me how to download the SW and install it myself. That process was fraught with problems, and after purchasing media, attempting several times, and speaking with customer service. I was instructed to order the SW online. The order required entering the current SW version number, which I got from the car display. However, that number was not accepted by the order entry program. Eventually, I was able to guess at a change in punctuation and additional characters, based on the SW version number that was going to be supplied, and able to get the order to go through. All of this is completely unnecessary waste of time for me, the customer. 

Now, you want to survey me to check on Vincent? As I said, HE is NOT the problem.  Genesis and its high-level decision makers are the problem. The only consolation I can take in this is if my feedback actually gets read and acted upon by someone who gives a crap.

Unfortunately after having my car serviced my driver profile was deleted and my wife's driver profile lost some of its settings, for example all of my wife's radio stations were deleted.  I was told that the issues are likely due to an over the air software update however I called the techs from my car and they confirmed that the last software update was on January 18 and that no other updates were applied to the car since then so they confirmed that the issues that I mentioned above are due to changes that were made at the dealership.  Also, on the day that we purchased the G80 my wife pointed out that the glove compartment had a chip of paint missing.  We were told that this would get taken care of for us and that it isn't a problem.  This repair was finally done for us with our most recent servicing.  When the car was returned to us there was a bill for this repair.  At that time the driver who dropped off our car called the dealership but was unable to get someone to speak to on the phone so we were told someone would call us back about this incorrect charge.  I also texted Ryan to ask him to call me back to discuss this.  Ryan was sick with the flu so I totally understand that he needs to rest up and feel better before getting back to me but I was hoping that Ryan or someone else would have called me back by now. 
I think your dealership is doing many things right and everyone is super friendly and everyone tries to be as helpful as they can but unfortunately, as you can see, the last service visit did not go as smoothly as I would have liked and now I am nervous about brining my car in since it takes a while to go through and set up all of the driver profile settings.  Note: the previous service visit also resulted in settings being changed in our profiles.
I know that everyone at the dealership takes a great deal of pride in their job so I welcome a call back to discuss all of this and to hopefully figure out how to make sure things go smoothly moving forward.",34929101,"","",02/20/2024,02/20/2024,02/20/2024,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,26498142,,Scott,Seyffarth,,scott.srs@verizon.net,,,,,,,2023,Genesis,G80,KMTGB4SD6PU191783,98.109.148.250,304c,,98.109.148.250,'Chrome 105.0.0.0','Windows 10',22811193,CA,2024/02/18 11:42:10,2024/02/18 12:11:07,Genesis Connected Services,Feature/Function,GCCC Care,GCCC Care,26498142,28216731,,6506,MAHMOUD.ABUZANAT01,Eastern Region,Genesis Eastern District 1,NJ701,Y,GENESIS BRAND - GCS SERVICE LINK ASSISTANCE; DRIVER PROFILE INQUIRY; driver profile was deleted while vehicle is at the retailer and some settings were changed.,Advised owner that it could be that someone accidentally deleted the profile at the retailer,MAHMOUD,

The employee came in a car, took our car, left the car from the dealership in our parking area locked. I asked about it and the answer was I did not ask for a loan. How ridiculous it is the situation. 
In relation to the service, it seems to have been don well. They did a very quick wash in the car, but did not even vacuum the interior. I am just comparing to Lehman in Florida where we send our other Genesis for maintenance. Finally, we had a small scratch when the car was brand new.

NC703,45544,Genesis Of East Charlotte,Steven Goldman,02/24/2024,n/a,2,3,3,2,2,3,5,"I bought a 2024 Genesis gv80 in the beginning of December. ( Keffer of Charlotte NC). I was assured that there was a tech Genius that would be available to answer any questions as well as come to house to set up remotes for gate and garage.
Upon calling dealer I was informed that this position had been eliminated. Know one knew who was taking on this responsibility. I was asked who my salesman was and I informed the person on the phone that he ( Yaz) was no longer with dealership. No suggestion offered as to who was taking over for his recent sales. I then went onto ask for manager and was told  the manager was out for the day. I never received any follow up.
As a long time Bmw driver this is not the level of service I am used to. It’s particularly surprising, as this dealership is opening a building exclusively dedicated to selling AND servicing Genesis any day now .
I was also disappointed to hear that the echo that I am experiencing when making phone calls is a long standing known issue, that no effort had been made to let owners know about . The customer care rep was under the impression that a fix will happening he upcoming month but was not that assuring.Independent of that it is quite surprising that a luxury vehicle in this day an age still needs to be plugged in with a cord to use Apple Play.

The issue is that what I considered to be the best aspect of your service program, the valet pickup, has been discontinued for cars over three years old.  By limiting this aspect to three years or 36000 miles, you are cheapening the brand and acting as if it were not a true luxury brand  .  This policy is very disappointing and I would be lying if I said that it wouldn't factor into my calculus when I am ready to purchase a new car.

I am, however, very concerned about my 2022 GV80. It stalled out a few months ago. Had the fuel pump that was recalled replaced as that's what they felt it was. I got my car back and there has been a terrible echo on the phone in the car ever since. Now I had a very serious incident where the car shook violently while driving it. It felt like all 4 wheels were going to fall off until I was safely able to pull over. I turned the car off and on and it stopped. I have an appointment Tuesday for Freehold Genesis to look at it, but no loaner car was available.
Although I do appreciate you reimbursing me on a rental car it's still a major inconvenience and more importantly a safety issue. I do not feel comfortable driving it. That shouldn't be. We really stretched our budget with this vehicle, and I can't afford a new one. These are not issues I expect from a practically new car. I'm very concerned about my future with the vehicle I love.

There are several people in my family that purchased new Genesis vehicles due to my recommendations. The issue is that while making phone calls using Carplay, the party you're talking to hears a huge echo. This does not happen on my other vehicle brands with Carplay, therefore, I know it's not an issue with my phones. I contacted Genesis because I found out that this is a common problem since the update. The answer I received back a few days later is to lower the volume to 20 which is impossible to hear, or use bluetooth.  They aslo wrote that Genesis is aware of the situation and are working on a fix. When you purchase an expensive vehicle from a premium brand, this is not acceptable. There needs to be a solution right away. Genesis should reverse the update until a fix can be developed. Carplay is one of the mail reasons I bought this vehicle. I would not purchase a vehicle that does not have it working.

I had my oil changed recently at Genesis and was told that the oil was found 2 quarts low. I did not have any leaks in the driveway so the technician who changed the oil must have not filled to the proper level. I was told this would not hurt the vehicle in any way but this cannot be good for the engine. 
Seems everything is OK now but I will check my oil level myself after my next oil change. Service manager did a great job with securing me a car and having everything ready and completed quickly.

This was EXTREMELY disappointing, but Tiara solved it in a few hours. Please thank her. In addition, I would check in on Lehman Genesis and look into their poor management of the situation. Please let me know what reason they could provide. I am concerned about the level of service going forward. I addition, the type of driving I do requires 2,000 mile intervals.

,,,Eugene Richmond,03/02/2024,n/a,5,5,5,5,1,5,10,"While Dale was EXTREMELY courteous and did all he could to get my problem resolved; the experience with Delray Genesis anything but. I brought my 2022 GV70 to them on Jan 17 for 2 recalls and a routine service. On day before, the “check engine “ light came on. I notified the service tech, and was told it was probably just a misfire and he would take care of it. It was out when it came back, and came back on a day after I got it back. I called Delray Genesis, and the tech told me “don’t worry about it “. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE in my opinion. The first appointment they could give me using the concierge service was not for 6 weeks, again TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. So I am going to drive the car to them myself on March 15th and wait for them to check it, all the while driving it with the check engine light on. And they won’t (or can’t) tell me when the fuel pump will be available that is being replaced for the recall.
I have owned 6 Genesis products since 2011, and currently own the 2022 GV70, a 2019 G90, and a 2023  G90. While I am a big fan of the Genesis product, the service provided by the likes of Delray Genesis may cause me to rethink my choice of auto brands. (I will say, I have used Genesis of West Warwick in Rhode Island when at my summer home there, and that was the kind of experience one would expect dealing with a luxury auto brand.)",34994751,"","",02/28/2024,03/02/2024,03/02/2024,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,5776342,,Eugene,Richmond,,generichmond@cox.net,,,,,,,2022,Genesis,GV70,KMUMADTB3NU046776,73.244.224.224,02c3,,73.244.224.224,'Mobile Safari 17.3.1','iOS 17.3.1',22850788,CA,2024/02/26 08:03:02,2024/02/26 13:31:49,Campaign,016G Fuel Pump Assy,GCCC Care,GCCC Care,5776342,6166682,,9103,DALE.BARRO,Southern Region,Genesis Southern District 3,FL750,Y,"RECALL 016G INQUIRY; 2022 GV70; MAINTENANCE SERVICE INTERVAL; IN VEHICLE RESET, MYGENESIS, TIMELINE INQUIRY, FEATURE INQUIRY","Schedule appointment at DelRay Genesis for April 15, 10am  Called owner back and for the recall 016G and the check engine light is on after Owner was just serviced  call dropped ",DALE,

,,,Krushant Patel,03/02/2024,n/a,2,5,4,2,1,4,3,The issue was not resolved. I am tired of explaining it over and over again. For context I leased a 2022 G70 from Genesis of North Plainfield and lease ends in November 2024. Recently everytime I call or show up for service the dealership has issues and gives attitude when I’m trying my best to keep my composure. Couple days ago I had my service scheduled I show up there and they tell me their systems have been down since the day prior they suggested I leave the car there call a ride and they will service the car and call me when it’s done. For my service I asked for a loaner because I have work obligations and I can’t wait hours for the service to be done. One I took half day from work that day so I can get my service done. Two it was early morning appointment so I dealt with the traffic getting there and on my way out of there. Three I live 10 miles from the dealership so I add miles on my car everytime I go for service. Obviously I am going to have to pay for the extra miles at the end of my lease and they simply don’t care because it’s coming out of my pocket. Well I care about the car I drive so obviously I don’t want to ruin the engine by not getting it serviced in a timely manner. Again if anything happens to the engine of the car I’ll be the one who’s charged for it it’s going to come out of my pocket not theirs. So later that day I give them a call back I explain the oil change situation to the customer service of the dealership that I need to get the oil change soon as possible. Mind you for my initial appointment they made me wait 2 weeks and right now the gauge shows “-183 miles until service” and when I called to reschedule they were going to make me wait 3 more weeks. Again the oil change is overdue. I can’t wait 3 more weeks. And again anything happens to the car it’s coming out of my pocket at the end of the lease. Andrew was nice enough to help me schedule service asap at a different location. But even that doesn’t make sense it’s farther from me at this point I’m adding miles for servicing the car. I was planning to get the gv80 once the lease ends on this car but no it’s time for me to move on from genesis it’s not worth my time. And it’s frustrating because I have to answer to my manager why I’m taking half days to get my car serviced every week. So no the issue was not resolved at all. I absolutely don’t recommend genesis to anyone I regret getting it myself. ,35020963,Low Score 2 & 3 Star Response,"",03/02/2024,03/02/2024,03/02/2024,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,22804432,,Krushant,Patel,,krushantpatel12@gmail.com,,,,,,,2022,Genesis,G70,KMTG34TAXNU092303,68.199.158.156,dc1f,,68.199.158.156,'Mobile Safari 17.3.1','iOS 17.3.1',22863926,CA,2024/02/28 06:28:42,2024/02/29 12:23:33,Service - Retailer,Treatment,GCCC Care,GCCC Care,22804432,24434664,4455141,,ANDREW.TEMPLETON,Eastern Region,Genesis Eastern District 1,NJ710,Y,"GENESIS RETAILER SERVICE COMPLAINT; 2022 G70; CUST had an APPT with NJ702, but had to reschedule as their system was down when he went in, and their next available APPT was not until 3/28/202",SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT AT NJ710 FOR 3/5/2024 AT 10AM  Will follow up  with retailer,ANDREW,

Sarah was very professional and spent a great deal of time trying to answer my dashboard setting questions.  Together we tried several different avenues to resolve the settlings question.  I own a 2023 GV70 and am very satisfied with the car.  However on the dash board between the speedometer  and the tachometer is a space that offers a compass,  a GV70 with green lines on both sides of the picture, tire pressure, trip information, etc. - when you get to select contents it will project the MPH in that space.  However after a couple of seconds the MPH information goes off.  How do I have the MPH displayed while I am moving?  Case# 22891189.

,,,Russell Miller,03/08/2024,n/a,3,3,4,3,2,3,5,"I bought my Genesis G-90 all wheel drive 5 liter brand new from a dealer in Alexandria Virginia.  I am what you might call a “car guy” with 8 cars currently.  I generally like the car with a few minor nit picks.  What has galled me that an artiicle in Car and Driver magazine indicates that my car is subject to a recall, based on a BUILD DATE (indicated in the door jamb) of January 15, 2019.  I bought the car new in early 2020.  Your Genesis representative in Arizona assured me that the car has NOT been recalled based in the VIN number and your website suggests the same.  My concern is that the Hyundai/Genesis letters to the national Highway Traffic Safety Adninistration (NHTSA) and the NHTSA website itself says the RECALL letters from Genesis to consumers like myself will not   Be mailed until some time in APRIL, while I read the article in the C&D magazine in FEBRUARY.  To compound my loss of confidence in t he car and your company, the recall warns that the car can burst into flames and burn to the ground if water invades the starter/solenoid assembly from rain puddles.  BOTTOM LINE: I NEED A DEFINITIVE RESPONSE FROM HYUNDAI GENESIS THAT MY CAR IS OR IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE RECALL AND THAT I CAN / CANNOT PARK IT IN MY GARAGE WITHOUT FEAR OF BURNING MY HOUSE DOWN.

MD705,45770,Genesis Of Bel Air,Armando Casanova,03/13/2024,n/a,2,5,5,5,3,2,5,"Representative Devyn was simply amazing. Great listener, responsive, offering thorough and empathetic follow up on a very complex situation that in the end reflects Genesis' inability as a brand.  There was nothing that he could've done beyond that which he attempted, which honestly blew way past my expectations.

When Genesis decided to cut dealerships, some of us were left long distances away from getting in-warranty and recall service.  My options are to go from Mechanicsburg PA to Owings Mills MD (75 miles each way), or Bel Air MD (72 miles each way).  Every other remaining Genesis dealer is beyond 100 miles each way.  The Owings Mills did not respond to Devyn's several-day plea for service and the Bel Air kind of pushed back at him asserting that it is my problem to get the car there if I really want warranty service. (Devyn did not say this, but after three days of trying, the best he could do was get me an appointment with a suggestion that I rent a car and submit the receipt to Genesis for reimbursement. SOME BRAND PROMISE!!) 

I purchased my car from Genesis of Towson MD and had it serviced for three-plus years by Genesis of York PA (Jack Giambalvo) - the latter is 30 miles from my house and remains a meaningful Hyundai dealer. They were always white glove quality and I just can't fathom why can't they service my car with the same equipment and human capital that they still have, instead of relaying this 'it sucks being you' attitude I've received from your remaining dealers.

My 2020 G90 is in excellent condition, but as a 70YO retired dude, these impositions are impractical.  I cannot honestly recommend Genesis to anyone on Central Pennsylvania after this disappointment.  And I will need to get me something else that offers service.

Bottom line, Devyn is an asset and a credit to your Company. Keep HIM, and change everything else you need in order not to hang car owners like me out to dry.

This is hands down the lowest quality service I have ever had from a car brand.
The connected services person (not her fault), was not able to schedule my service.  That was an entire waste of a 15-20 minute call.
the dealership did not even call me back until afternoon the following day.   5 weeks to be able to have the valet service.  total fail....
I have issues with the car, was never allowed to meet the GM of my dealership to discuss the issues.
the car has production defects, that service person (mark) told is just how it is - the car is rotting, and that began 90 days after pruchase.

I never filled out my original customer satisfaction survey - my salesman did it himself, and does not reflect my satisfaction with the purchase.

I am infuriated that in this case, I was told that it would be 5 WEEKS!!!!! to get valet service for my vehicle.  That is unheard of, and very low end...  Not what we were promised....

I was told to bring in the car that is couldn't get to start. Then I was told to have it towed to Springfield, VA, 75 miles from me as the Genesis dealer in Richmond, VA, 20 miles from me, was no longer a Genesis dealer and could not help me. The last call I received on Wednesday of last week, I was told whoever was assisting me was going to be out on Thursday  and Friday so I'd have to call and speak to someone else or wait until they returned.  In the meantime,  I called Genesis of Richmond,  VA and was told they absolutely are a Genesis dealer and could help me. After speaking to their service team, I was able to get my car started. Their simple instructions over the phone soled the issue.  I've had several bad experiences with Genesis now and am considering selling the car. It should not be this difficult to get assistance. I've had several people ask about the car and I can only tell them my experiences and to avoid the headaches.

Modern cars require massive computerization and are thus difficult for us older folks to figure out solutions to anything that goes amiss.  So your representative, Kelly's understanding was greatly appreciated.

,,,George Hubman,03/25/2024,n/a,2,1,5,5,1,5,10,"Having made the appointment three months ago, I was surprised to find that I was expected to have requested a loaner car.  At the time of making the reservation I was not asked “will you require a loaner vehicle, Mr. Hubman?”  Seems like that should be a given.

As a member of the Genesis Advisory Council I want to do all I can to to see to it that Genesis is recognized as, dollar for dollar, the best luxury brand in the world.

In the last thirty years I have owned an LS 400, an LS 430, four BMWs a Jaguar and an Infinity, not to mention my electric GV70 and and a 2018 G80.  Most service experiences have non-events or disappointments.  Except for Lexus.  When driving up the service rep, if quick enough, would probably open the door for you.  Back in the day of incandescent lights, they would check all of your bulbs and replace as needed.

Reps, cashiers, and parts department personnel were well dressed and, I might add, attractive.

I understand that Lee Johnson is constrained by their current facility.  But, they are the best thought of family of auto dealerships in Western Washington.  They have not yet made the transition from being a Chevy, Mazda, Kia, Hyundai dealership to being a luxury brand dealership.

I am happy to discuss this further with anyone interested.

She was nice, but like all of my many many calls to Genesis Customer Care, they have not been helpful as a support between myself - the owner, Safeguard the CPO company - that does not show the vehicle in my name and the retailer - who does not follow through and make sure that Safeguard changes the name of the CPO warranty into my name.

Poor, Poor customer service.  

Issues like reset my connected services - they do fine with that. But other issues, absolutely no follow up.  I had called the last week and the guy said he would get the issue fixed between Safeguard and the retailer.  I waited a week after not hearing, then called back only to find out he just dropped it because he did not know what to do.

Terrible.  I have been trying since 1/26/24 to get this resolved.  Have repeated the story countless times.  I am the middle man and cannot do anything about it.  The retailer will not complete his requirements to get Safeguard to change the name of the CPO in their system.  So I am left completely without any ability to make sure that all pieces of the CPO have been completed correctly.

Terrible.

The 2 stars have nothing to do with Alexis. She was terrific!  She was friendly, efficient, and professional. The 2 stars has to do with McGovern not being fully operational after being awarded the Genesis dealership in October of 2023. I’m located in Southern Vermont, so for me to have my car service in Albany is a HARDSHIP! I purchased my GV80 under Garvey in Queensbury, but now I have to deal with a dealer located 1-1/2 hours away. Not what I contracted for!  McGovern had 5 months to be up and running with their concierge service. Disappointing! I had to set aside a whole day just to have my scheduled PM. 3 hours traveling + 4 hours service! Oh, there were only 2 technicians working/available at McGovern’s during my appointment! Plus I have to eat the additional miles because of a dealership change that wasn’t in play when I signed my  lease. I would have never selected  McGovern, or any dealership that requires a 3 hour round trip from Southern Vermont to get standard service. I was also informed by a 3rd party that , if I need a courtesy car, it’s not going to be a Genesis vehicle. Is that correct? Could someone get back to me on that? (bmdolan51@gmail.com.)  I can also be reach at 973-953-1649. Could you please have someone at McGovern (or Genesis) contact me.

The GCS experience remains ""less than satisfactory."" It started over a year ago when I tried to renew my enrollment. Because there was no incentive to renew, I asked if any discounts were offered and was told, ""Not at this time."" As an appeasement, a ""supervisor"" offered me a price of $1.99 a month for  Connected Care, the additional services would cost the full subscription amount and the offer was only valid as a month-to-month billing. Another issue arose and I again contacted customer service, which resulted in an offer of ""no charge for all services for three months or until the system was upgraded."" The ""no-charge cost me $1.99 a month until my credit card on file expired. Overall, the experience has been, as I stated previously, not satisfactory. 
Additionally, in January, I was offered an incentive of a 50% discount for renewal. When I attempted to use that code, I was given the response that it was not valid for my vehicle. I then received an offer for a 40% discount to which I again got the response that it was not available for my vehicle.

Feel free to call me at 518 570 9398 if you want to hear all of the issues and the run arounds I have received.  I would suggest you take the money you pay for your golf tournament and use it to truly build a customer care unit that can solve your problem. Its. shame, such a beautiful car with such disastorous service.

I have called for assistance at least five times, never getting a solution or resolution during those calls.  I was told further assistance would be followed up by higher trained technicians, which would occur in 7-10 days. This resulted in one email that did not solve the issue and a call that was helpful but unrelated to the previous issues I was experiencing. You now closed my case out, stating that repeated calls and emails were attempted. I never got any other follow up calls. Your people may be courteous but they do not actually resolve problems. They seem to be more interested in closing out a case. Almost every interaction with them was fruitless. Fortunately, I have worked through most of my problems, not because of actual guidance from the manuals or your staff instruction, but because I have persistently tried and found other solutions which neither the manuals or your highly trained staff ever offered to me.

,,,Michael Hyde,04/10/2024,n/a,4,5,5,5,4,4,9,"As a relatively new (2021 GV80 - Previously driven by a sales manager), I’m delighted with the vehicle and anxious to begin utilize the new Genesis dealership scheduled to open in Downers Grove Illinois in fall 2024. My customer / vehicle service experience at the local Hyundai dealership(s) has fallen short of my “phenomenal experience” for 20 years with Lexus.  I understand Hyundai Motors/Genesis are working diligently on building your brand and Improving the customer service experience at a premium level. I wish you luck.

One matter i’ve been faced with recently.  I was out of town for several weeks when my connected car agreement/membership expired (March 2024). I was informed by the connected car service staff ( on the phone) that if I had responded to the email inquiry by Genesis about a renewal that I would’ve received discounts as I find the $297 annual fees for the three (3) applications/feature packages very expensive.  After spending such a large amount of money on a premium/luxury SUV.

Especially since owners of Genesis effective in 2023 pay nothing for the Connected Card service.

I was informed by the customer service representative that there are coupons available to  Genesis clients that provide discounts for customers/clients to renew connected care contracts/service agreements. I Was never enrolled or asked to enroll and I never did Receive anything.

I’d be delighted if someone would contact/call me and extend those Connected Car service price discount terms/benefits to me.  I’m frequently approached about my experience with the Genesis vehicle as it’s still relatively new on the roadways.  I hope to continue to be a strong advocate for the emerging Genesis brand.

I anxiously look forward to hearing from a Genesis concierge or customer service liaison to help me with this matter.

NV703,45870,Genesis Of Las Vegas,Patrice Paul,04/14/2024,n/a,5,5,5,5,5,5,10,"Delores was very helpful.  I feel very fortunate to have had her assistance during my call.  The below comments are related to my local dealership.  

First, it is very difficult to speak with a representative at the dealership by phone regarding appointment questions.  This resulted in my reaching out to your general customer service team at the 844#.  I would like to note that Delores ran into the same problem trying to connect with a live person during our interaction.  Second, it was discovered during my conversation with Delores that Genesis did not reach out to me regarding a recall on the vehicle.  It was this appointment that she was trying to help me schedule, and, unfortunately, the soonest appointment to address this recall problem was 3 weeks out.  

Has the appropriate department on your end noticed the rapidly expanding population here in Clark County (Las Vegas, Henderson, etc., Nevada)?  Presently, there is only one Genesis dealership to handle all customer needs this area.  The difficulties contacting them directly by phone and scheduling timely appointments seems to be related to the volume of business this location must handle.  I am hopeful that Genesis plans on opening a 2nd facility, perhaps in Henderson, to help facilitate the ability to address customer needs.

However all the idiot lights were flashing, I was getting messages in both English and Korean warning about door locks, lights, door locks and tire pressure.

I am driving around in a G70 that could catch fire or burn up a building!

According to Kiara, Genesis has no clue when the fix for the defective starter in my G70 will be available.

Volvo had a similar problem maybe 10 years ago.  They issued rental cars to all of the people affected until they solved the issue.

I recommend that Genesis a) give affected drivers a rental car until the issue is solved or b) set aside millions of dollars to handle lawsuits from people whose cars burn up.

I would also recommend that Genesis solve the starter issue immediately.

I bought my 2023 Genesis GV80 from Genesis of Danbury after waiting over 2 years for the specific vehicle that I wanted to come in. I ordered a 2021 and bought a 2023. Other than the wait, my experience at Danbury was very good both the delivery process and first service. When I went to schedule my next service at Danbury, I called repeatedly and got no answer. Finally, after doing some research online, I found that Genesis of Danbury was no longer in business and had been bought by Genesis of Ridgefield. I called to make an appointment with them but they told me that the service department would not be open until May. They took my info and promised to call and schedule an appointment. They said that the info/service records on my GV80 would be transferred.
Genesis of Danbury made a very convincing case for buying from them - ability to get vehicles quickly due to the volume of Genesis sales at both their dealers (Danbury and Stamford), superb customer service and specifically after vehicle delivery. This service included Service Valet for Life, not just the included 3 years.
To say the least, I am very disappointed at how Genesis of Danbury has treated me and the rest of their loyal customers. Not a call, email or text to detail how the Genesis ownership experience that started with them would continue and how the transition to a new dealer would be handled. Nothing, just an unanswered phone.....
This is not what I would have expected from Danbury, Genesis or any luxury car dealer....

She went above and beyond and contacted the dealer. We jointly spoke with the parts and service departments. My problem started on March 23rd when I took my car in for service after a service engine light appeared on my dash (BTW, it took 3.5 weeks to get an appointment; extremely poor). The technician diagnosed the issue and advised the Service Advisor of the problem. It was determined that a part needed to be ordered. The service advisor said it would take several days and scheduled me for a follow-up appointment on March 25th. He stated he would call me when the part arrived. It arrived, but I was never called back. Even after leaving several messages for the service advisor, I never receive a returned phone call. Therefore, I reached out to Customer Care and spoke with Delores. When we talked to the local dealer jointly, they confirmed that the part was on-site and ensured they would schedule me the next day. He said I would be receiving a call; of course, I did not. I am still awaiting service, and it's now been five weeks. I am deeply disappointed with Genesis and feel compelled to alert others to Genesis's poor service. As it stands, I have a car that Genesis apparently does not want to fix; even after ordering parts. 
If you care to speak with me, I can be reached at 704-804-3570. The proper resolution to this matter would be to arrange for immediate service. Unfortunately, I am having major surgery on April 30th and will be unable to have the car taken to the repair center. This surgery is crucial, and I need my car to be in a reliable condition before then. I would also like my service to be covered by warranty.  Finally, I want the dealership to be reprimanded and dealt with appropriately for their lack of attentiveness and commitment to customer satisfaction.

There has been a safety recall but the closest Genesis dealer is now 73+ miles away in Kirkland, WA.  The service department is willing to meet me in Mount Vernon, WA but it means that I either have to drive to Mt. Vernon myself - 30 miles away or get a driver to take me there.  I can drive on the freeway but do not do so very often since I am 85 years old.  I still consider myself a good driver but tend to only drive my car short distances.  So, I contacted both the Kirkland dealership through their web page (no answer yet) and decided to call Genesis customer care to express my disappointment and frustration over not having the dealer picking the car up at my residence.  I feel since it is a company recall that the closest dealership should pick it up no matter the distance.  And, I am not sure where I will be able to get normal service done for my 2021 Genesis once the warranty is up.

In a nutshell, I bought a GV60 performance and was supposed to have the valet service for service visits.  Apparently (after several calls with the dealer), the dealer knows nothing about that service, and requires that I drop the car off personally in order to have the recall fixed.   I tried calling Genesis Customer Care at Genesis Motor America and they didn't care, and said something like, ""I guess some dealers don't offer that service...Can I help you with something else"".   I'm very disappointed with Genesis'  efforts to sell me on this car with features like the valet service for 3 years,, and now that I have it, they are not willing to honor it.  I am also very dissatisfied with the lack of attention to this matter.  I have not received ANY reply to my comments for Case number is 23192541.   Frankly, I don't care so much about the valet service, but I am really annoyed that I was promised something and now Hyundai/Genesis doesn't care about actually delivering on their service.  I could have bought any car I wanted, but I wanted to give Genesis a try.  It was a big mistake. I simply don't trust that Genesis will honor its commitments.  It is impossible for me to recommend Genesis to anyone else.

,,,Heather Kwok,05/04/2024,n/a,2,2,2,2,1,1,3,"I needed to schedule my GV70 EV regular maintenance appointment. I used the app in the car to call to make an appointment. Timothy was courteous but had to put me on a hold to call the local dealer to schedule. He came back a few times to tell me that he was still trying to get through to them. 10 minutes later he came back to let me know he was still trying to reach them (not his fault) and I had to leave my car so had to end the call. He said he'd call me back once he got an appointment but I never heard back from him. It would have been good to get a call back since he offered that. I had to go through the process separately again to get an appointment scheduled. I would say that overall Genesis' dealership service department experience has been terrible. We got hit and the body shop needed to order parts and they literally could not get a hold of anyone or a response from the parts department for weeks. I finally called the dealership sales department twice, first time no luck in getting a response, second time they gave me the parts persons email and finally responded. The parts person told me that he doesn't listen and respond to voicemails. What?!? I think the parts department at the Kirkland dealership needs to staff more people to fill this vital role since there is only one employee in Washington State dealing with parts and he obviously seems swamped and unable to do the bare minimum of responding to calls, voicemails and emails.  Genesis really needs to put more resources towards customer service on the local level since Genesis is getting a bad rep online in this regard and losing potential sales because people who can afford these EV cars do not want to go through all this hassle and poor customer experience, for a premium car this is NOT a premium experience and people will take their purchasing power elsewhere unless this gets resolved. I love my car but would not buy one in the future if this continues to be the trend in the local service levels.

The problem. Confusing answers are confusing. Each one had a different way of rebooting. The car computer overly confusing was given the answer that when you go to locate the car, it gives you your location, and all of a sudden it jumps to cars located in Costa Mesa, customer said that’s the default it’ll always do that, doesn’t make sense if I’m going to locate it come up to Costa Mesa very unhappy. The map update stuck has been trying to update for two weeks, customer service went to connect me with the map.
