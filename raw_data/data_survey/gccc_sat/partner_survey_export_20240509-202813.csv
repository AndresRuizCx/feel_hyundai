I made an appointment again for drop-off for the following day. Everything went smoothly except an issue with the vehicle could not be determined. It's a lease and I only have less than a year left, so I'm not concerned about it.

My car was very clean when I dropped it off. I had just had it washed a couple of days before. When I picked it up it had been parked in the back of the lot and was covered in dust. There was oil droplets on the front grill area (had an oil change) and handprints all over the vehicle.

Not at all the level of care I expect from a brand that markets as luxury. Also, I never am assisted by a Genesis service representative. I had better care with Acura. Overall disappointed with Holler from the beginning.

,,,Bryan Baisden,01/11/2023,n/a,1,,5,5,3,1,3,"Based on my experience with scheduling my first service, I would not recommend the brand. That said, it’s my understanding that a stand alone Genesis dealership is opening on Fulton in Sacramento and Roseville Hyundai is building a separate and dedicated Genesis service garage. We will see how that goes. A lack of stand alone Genesis dealerships and better service experience/availability trumps all of the nice things about the vehicle up to this point. God forbid I ever have a serious issue with this vehicle. The Greater Sacramento area is simply too large to not have at least one stand alone Genesis dealership and more than one  service option. There can’t be only one game in town. Online scheduling also allowed me to book service in Folsom. I took time off work to drive out, only to be told they don’t service Genesis at that dealership any longer. No apologies were made. I waited to speak on the phone to the service manager at Roseville for 16 mins before finally hanging up. I then called Genesis direct and they put in a call to have a manager call me and I still never received a call back about the scheduling fiasco (waiting 7 weeks for an oil change). Lastly, once I finally received service, I waived the car wash and vacuum, as it was a rainy day and because I’m very meticulous. However, the construction must have had them drive my vehicle or walk over a dirt/muddy road, as dirt and debris was all over my floor. I had just vacuumed beforehand, so it was very apparent.  I mean, it’s a nice vehicle. If shoes are really dirty or muddy, use a temporary paper floor mat cover. That said, use temporary floor mat covers regardless. I shouldn’t have to come home and wipe dirt off the floor. I even covered my seat and center console with towels to protect the Vanilla Beige interior and the console towel was in the floor when the car was given back to me. The entire experience was unacceptable and very disappointing. Wouldn't experience any of this at Lexus or even Toyota for that matter! The person that helped me on the day of the appointment was the only bright spot.

I called the Concierge number and they tried calling the dealership to set an appointment for me. They could not get the dealer (Gurnee Illinois) to answer their phones after multiple tries. The person said they would try the next day and call me back, 3 days went by and no call back. So I called again and the person tried Gurnee location and no response, they tried Glevview Illinois and the phone would not even ring. Then we tried Gurnee again and finally got someone on the phone who did not seem to know much about Genesis. I asked the concierge person what Hyundai locations provided service on Genesis cars and she said that kind of list did not exist. How can you not have a list of service locations.  So I buy two Genesis vehicles on the same day, and now have to get serviced by an organization that seems like they've never had to service a car before, like your new to this, and also by far no special service like other luxury car manufactures.

When the Genesis representative responded to my feedback, he said that Genesis has no way to help since the loaners are provided by the dealership.   I can tell you that having had many car brands in the past, I have never experienced such problems with a loaner.  At this price point I question Genesis long term relationship with customers if the service experience is going to be as bad as what I am experiencing.

,,,Scott Hilsee,01/22/2023,n/a,1,,1,1,1,5,0,"Time after time, Genesis does not fail to disappoint as a brand.  Any time I have reached out to ask a question or report a problem, I have been dismissed by a representative who has no concern at all for me as a customer. While I appreciate the ""we already have your money"" mentality, I didn't expect that would be my experience from a self-proclaimed ""luxury"" brand. When other car manufacturers attempt to politely resolve issues and address concerns, Genesis has eagerly ignored me at every opportunity.

I could not be less satisfied with my ownership experience. From the terrible connected services (which don't en work anymore) to the disdainful treatment by service departments to the complete lack of care from Genesis as a brand, you have been consistent in your failure to provide customer service.

The next time I have a problem, I'll consider telling a housecat. It will have similar results but save a lot of time. I have been telling everyone who will listen what a disappointment this car is, and I look forward to continuing to spread the word.

My low ranking for recommending the brand is related to the continued poor service I have received at NUMEROUS service departments throughout Metro Detroit. I love my G70, but I loathe anytime I need to have any service performed. Genesis has to get this fixed if they want to be a serious contender not just in the luxury market, but as a simple car brand.  Contact me anytime for additional details.

,,,Kristy Thompson,01/30/2023,n/a,4,,4,4,4,3,5,"This is a difficult survey to respond to.  First of all, if I'd known that I would not be able to locate a Genesis dealership to have my service needs tended to, I WOULD NOT have purchased my beautiful GV80!  I have driven only high end luxury vehicles for the last 25 years, and have become accustomed to going to their high end facilities for service.  There is a HUGE gap in what I'm used to and what a Hyundai dealership offers!  
Regarding my experience with the Genesis concierge service, it was a mix of quality.  Susan was friendly and seemed competent.  However, the details she gave me regarding what I would receive at the Hyundai service appointment did not line up with what reality was.  For example, she told me that my first service should be done at 1 year or 7,000 or 8,000 (I can't remember which of these 2 numbers she stated) miles, whichever came first (I have owned my vehicle since 10-30-2021, and I was at a 6600+ miles.),  and that I needed to get the service done asap, since I'd passed the 1 year mark.  The service adviser at the Hyundai dealership told me that my first service was not due until 8,000 miles, and that having it done now will throw off my service timeline.  Since I had had a frustrating time even getting an appointment for service, he kindly agreed to go ahead and do the service.  Susan also told me that after the completion of service, my car would be thoroughly cleaned.  The service advisor told me that is not the case, that all they do is run it through a wash for exterior wetting, but no drying and no interior cleaning at all.  I don't know why there was such a disconnect between what Susan in concierge services and what the service advisor at the dealership said, but it was very discouraging for me.  Overall,  my opinion of Genesis has dropped dramatically because of all this.  On a side note, I actually contacted concierge because of the trouble I had getting into a Hyundai dealership for service.  I lived in the Dallas-Forth Worth metroplex, and the only dealership that even answered my calls was in Denton, which is 51.7 miles from my home.  The dealerships literally either did not answer the phone at all, or the service department did not answer my transferred calls.  One transfer call to the service department (Weatherford, TX), had a message instructing me to leave a message; however, the voicemail was full and could not accept any more calls!  Genesis surely understands that people who purchase luxury vehicles expect a higher standard of service!

As one who has owned all the top luxury brands (Mercedes,  BMW, AUDI, Porsche, Lexus, Acura, Cadillac) I can attest that Genesis service is subpar.  I called about this issue and i got a valet instead of a service rep.  I was told to handle things on my own, to call other numbers.  Furthermore, the facilities and amenities are worse than a honda dealership (I understand they are building a new facility) - my general sense is that they dont treat Genesis customers as the high end luxury segment that they should - i felt more like Hyundai.   You never tell a customer who forked over that much money they can't resolve a problem, and that it is not your issue, you cant do anything about it.

He than was “shushed” by a lead technician who then starting to detail how this problem coukd only be determined by removing the front bumper which would cost an intial
$507. This shocked me and i refused this type of service and asked them to rotate tires and do a visual of front bumper sensors to the best of their abilities. Of course I got my car back they found nothing so I went out on the highway , put cruise control on with level L1 and of course it worked fine.

The rep said it may be an issue with the app on my phone (even though it was the vehicle having issues). He asked what kind of phone I had and when I told him galaxy s9, he said ""you should be fine. "" He had me uninstall the app (which was working) and then reinstall. But when I went to reinstall, the app store said that it was not compatible with my phone. I am now stuck without the app unless I get a whole new phone. He kept telling me to update my phone OS, but it has the most recent available for it.

This is frustrating, because he was able to instruct me on how to reset the service in my car and that is what fixed it.

NY704,45560,Genesis Of The South Shore,Ira Salwen,02/08/2023,n/a,1,,2,1,1,3,5,"I am driving my 4th Genesis and love the car.  My husband and I always lease and our last two leases were through South Shore Hyundai in West Islip, NY.  The lease on our 2019 G80 would have been up March of 2022. In March of 2021 the dealer reached out and asked us to come in, we thought to turn our leased vehicle in early.  They encouraged us to switch to ownership since Covid was effecting supply and price.  We were very reticent to do this but were pressured and told turning it in would not be a problem and our lease price would remain about the same whenever we did it.  Recently we received  a recall notice and our Connected Services were eliminated so we decided to turn the car in.  We were shocked when this same dealer told us our lease would be an extra $500 a month and we should never have on off lease!  We were used and abused.  They suggested we get rid of warranties we have to lower the buyout price.  Repeated calls and emails to the salesman about how we accomplish have gone unanswered.  In good faith we actually ordered a new Genesis but we don't have any good faith left.",32288407,"","",02/08/2023,02/08/2023,02/08/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,5570517,,Ira,Salwen,,isalwen@gmail.com,,,,,,,2019,Genesis,G80,KMHGN4JE0KU289891,108.6.218.174,e824,,108.6.218.174,'Chrome 109.0.0','Windows 10',20940206,CA,2023/02/01 09:40:05,2023/02/06 11:54:32,Sales - Retailer,Treatment,Siebel Administrator,GCCC Care,5570517,9591000,,38078,TIFFANY.ARBALLO,Eastern Region,Genesis Eastern District 5,NY704,Y,GENESIS BRAND - GENESIS MOTOR FINANCE,Provided information.,TIFFANY,

The Genesis rep basically gave me a quick rundown of what I was going to have to do, but after trying to do this to no avail, I called back and they connected me to the navigation updater site.   This again, was quite confusing as I had to purchase a thumb drive.   Then, after repeated attempts, the navigator update rep walked me through the process.  He was not the most cordial person and this took considerable time.   I was very displeased with the whole process.

Unfortunately, the direction from Genesis Engineering Corporate was not accurate, and they- (my dealer representative) , wasted an entire day chasing down a resolution that did NOT exist. My dealer's representative- Paul Walkins was able to figure out a solution and resolve my issues on the third day.  So my score of 5 whether I would recommend Genesis is that Genesis Corporate has fallen short on their concierges service-loaner vehicle, and that they did not give my dealer the correct diagnosis causing additional delays. In fact, I will be contacting my dealer again, as some other issues developed from the update nav which is where all the problems started. Genesis has a very barbaric method of updating the nav system, and although it's updated, it has changed some things in the system overall. The volume is now very much lower, and when you shut the car off the aux. does not stay on for the 5 minutes it used to. I hope to see Genesis stick to their model of luxury vehicles, with loaner vehicles, and service that exceeds the industry standards. I hope they can change my mind on their brand.

And because I have to wait for a USB from Mapnsoft, I still don’t know what will happen when I actually download the first update. Each time I called, I got another small piece of information. I finally learned on the 3rd or 4th call that the first update has to be loaded manually - which is nonsense! Then I purchased a larger USB for $52 that I didn’t need to download the update but it didn’t work because it was too large!! (It is ridiculous by the way that if you buy a larger USB than needed, it won’t work - of course no one told me that until after I bought the $52 USB and tried to load the update!!) I finally learned what the Mapnsoft was needed for and ordered the USB from them! So I spent probably 4 hours going back and forth trying to figure it out, download the update and trying to install it. It was my most frustrating experience with Genesis to date. I hope I don’t experience it again. The way to update GPS should be clearly explained and perhaps emails sent out to customers or maybe even just send the USB from Mapnsoft if it can’t be done automatically the first time as would be expected for a luxury brand.

So I called to get info and was told there were 3 levels of ""connection,"" each costing $99 per year.  But if I could get a 20% discount.  After repeatedly asking for a better ""deal"" I was told if I ordered 2 levels I could get a 40% discount, which I did.  Only then while reviewing off unopened emails did I see an off to purchase at 50% off.  This is one reason car dealers have such a shady reputation.  I love my car but hate the buying experience for a car costing $85000.  I expected Genesis to be an up and coming brand like Lexus (that I owned since 1990).  Instead Hyundai is only a ""want a be Toyota.""  I even removed the G E N E S I S letters on the rear (trunk) since my experiences have been so negative.",32396139,Low Score 2 & 3 Star Response,"",02/24/2023,02/25/2023,02/25/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,23124702,,Steven,Harsey,,stevenharsey446@gmail.com,,,,,,,2020,Genesis,G90,KMTF54PH7LU076697,76.95.187.162,9bb2,,76.95.187.162,'Safari 16.2','Mac OS X 10.15.7',21044384,CA,2023/02/22 12:32:20,2023/02/22 13:08:38,GCS Subscription,Enrollment,GCCC Care,GCCC Care,23124702,24734653,,,MONICA.PIQUERO,,,,Y,GCS ENROLLMENT ASSISTANCE,Provided assistance,MONICA,

,,,Jeanne Gorski,03/01/2023,n/a,5,,5,5,5,5,10,"Our service advisor Melisa was helpful and extremely knowledgeable, I appreciate all of her efforts.  It was a pleasant surprise to see that the service tech cleaned/rinsed off the 'WeatherTech' style floor mats.  However the mats were put in the vehicle while still wet on the bottom side, causing the carpet to become wet.  Although it was apparent the mats were cleaned, the fact that the carpet was wet was uncovered a couple days later given the interior of the windows would keep uncharacteristically fog up after the car sat for a period of time after driving.

I deliberately paid an extra 10K plus to not have a Telluride of Pallisade experience when buying the Genesis, but believ me I regret my decision now. Your entire brand is showing prolonged teething problems. Your Genesis Concierge is a JOKE!

And why in the world is it not possible to truly personalize profiles, and have it be saved for good (Auto-hold, for instance).  The list is too long if you care to listen, BUT to top it all off, I have NEVER taken a car for a scheduled service (from cheap subcompacts to truly luxury brands) where the dealer has returns the car to me WITHOUT a car wash!  This last part of the service experience is truly bewildering, again cheapening the brand experience that you so desperately want to improve.

Prior to making the service appointment I had been trying for months to do the update via Flash drive. It will either not load onto my flash drive or when I get it to the car, the ""update"" button is not highlighted, so the download can not begin. The customer service person I spoke with on Saturday was very helpful but unable to resolve my issue.  It should not be this difficult to update my navigation. I am not sure why my dealer would  not do it while they had my car for service. They also do not offer concierge service and I live about 40 miles from the closest dealer.

(The concierge strive has been paid for and included in the purchase price of my vehicle, why would I want to drive an extra 2 hours to drop off my vehicle if I’ve already paid for a certain level of service?) this location has failed multiple times with calling back after leaving messages, and also updating me on service status(last time they had my vehicle for 6 weeks) and I’m going back to address the same issue they “fixed” last time!  The biggest problem is the next closest option for service is 160 miles away.

I know you guys have given us the same car to drive. But it's not comfortable and there was no communication during the first two weeks.

I requested for the lane change. To be fixed. Still not working. (Bad )
I requested there was this noise when I back out on a cold weather. On the. Driver front wheel. I FEEL THE SOUUND ,. (Bad )
The only thing you guys did change the windshield. Which another company did. (Good ). But you CHARGED $108 to change up. Windshield wiper blade. That is a eally stupid cost.
Or maybe the reason is you don't want anyone to come. For maintenance of their car to your office.
You have changed the belt buckle. (Good ).

Such BS…This is why I won’t recommend you even though people ask about my car all the time! I tell them it’s a nice car but GOOD luck with Genesis backing their promises! Disappointing! You guys want me to schedule my oil changes 1 month in advance and my answer is I have a busy life!  I don’t sit around pondering oil changes. I had to pay for my last oil change too! ABSURD & UNACCEPTABLE. Hold true to your promises. There is a car shortage. Don’t tell me you can’t fit me in. F*^% that! Tell your dealerships to pull their heads out of their asses!

So I had to reschedule the next appointment  for two and a half weeks out, even though I told the reprehensive I was driving on a long trip and the service indicator on the vehicle indicated the service was over due. I thought when I purchased this premium vehicle service would have better availability.

According to the owner's manual, they recommend 0w30. The dealership put 5w30 oil in my car, which I guess I would never know what they actually put in my car at anytime, but I noticed the sticker said 5w30.   When I questioned it, the service rep said, ""don't worry about it, we do this all the time.""  I would like the recommended oil put in my car, so I'm not sure what to do about that.  Call them in advance and ask them to order the correct oil? This is a new car. I want to do everything correctly with it.  Also, this is a little thing but when I had my Volvo and I took it into the dealership, they would wash my car. Not a big deal, but just a little more upscale service.

He said I needed to take the car in for for service,  which was neither surprising nor upsetting.  And, the fact that the dealership responded with an appointment four weeks away was not his fault. In fact, he apologized for it. But, the idea that it takes a month to get a service appointment (and this is not the first time I experienced this) leads directly to my dissatisfaction with both the customer care experience and my disinclination to recommend Genesis as a brand. (This is NOT a luxury car ownership experience.) This despite my overall appreciation of my G90.  It's a great car, and I really enjoy driving it. However, I am dreading this service appointment. My nav screen is delaminating and the entire nav unit is randomly freezing and has lost touch with my phone app. I also cannot use the Google navigation aid despite having a subscription. It always tells me I have no network connection. And, the rep tells me that as a second owner I have no warranty coverage.

,,,Anthony Autrey,03/19/2023,n/a,5,,5,5,5,5,5,"First, Scott called me regarding my emailed issue on the very day I sent it in and that day was listed that Customer Care was closed. I was surprised to get that quick a response, especially on a ""closed"" day. I much appreciate the manner he handled my situation and the ease and timeliness of the correction to the issue. Kudos to Scott!! That being said, the following has nothing to do with my interaction with Scott. However, I am taking the opportunity to express my disappointment with the Genesis brand since our purchase due the manner in which Genesis and their relationship with dealers has evolved. Because of Genesis desire to evolve their brand, the Genesis dealership I purchased my car from, ceased to perform any covered service on the car. The explanation was that Genesis wanted the brand to disassociate from the Hyundai dealership unless they provided a standalone location. The dealership did not provide one, so they had to cease sale of Genesis vehicles and no longer provide the maintenance service included with the Genesis vehicles without the customer paying for the service. This dealership was 70 miles from my home (which I accepted as I wanted the Genesis brand), however I now must schedule and drive over 200 miles to obtain the service and maintenance which was part of the specifications in the car purchase. Not only is this inconvenient and requires overnight stays or possibly additional transportation costs, but in general, is totally unacceptable. As a customer, I have been placed in middle of this ""tug-of-war"" and feel that the corporation cares little about me as a consumer of their product. This should not happen with a vehicle purchased at this price point (or any other for that matter). As a result this has dampened my enthusiasm for the vehicle brand.",32510846,"","",03/14/2023,03/19/2023,03/19/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,24880001,,Anthony,Autrey,,tautrey55@gmail.com,,,,,,,2022,Genesis,GV80,KMUHBDSB7NU092885,67.60.61.248,d76f,,67.60.61.248,'Chrome 111.0.0','Windows 10',21129517,CA,2023/03/12 12:50:03,2023/03/12 15:07:59,Remote Services,Functionality Concerns,Siebel Administrator,Genesis Email,24880001,27224034,,10317,SCOTT.BRUN,,,,Y,REMOTE SERVICES TROUBLESHOOTING; Connected services are not working.,Connected services are now working.,SCOTT,

,,,Eric Thomason,03/17/2023,n/a,2,,5,2,1,5,2,"I felt Genesis Customer Care passed the buck, so to speak. the reason I reached out was because a part to repair my vehicle (a 2022 GV70) cannot be located by the body shop who has been working a number of supplier lines, including through the local Hyundai dealer. I thought I made that clear and was hoping Genesis corporate could help locate the part. (Although, since then we have heard the part may not be manufactured again which seems wildly unimaginable for a 2022 model.)
I love my GV70. It is one of the quietest, most comfortable and fun-to-drive cars I've ever owned. But the inability to get a basic (yet critical) part and well as the scarcity of trained Genesis technicians makes me reluctant to keep my vehicle once it is repaired (if that ever happens) and reluctant to recommend the brand to family, friends and colleagues.",32531389,Low Score 2 & 3 Star Response,"",03/17/2023,03/17/2023,03/17/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,6937452,,Eric,Thomason,,ericthom57@gmail.com,,,,,,,2022,Genesis,GV70,KMUMADTB9NU070841,74.219.11.226,c387,,74.219.11.226,'Safari 16.3','Mac OS X 10.15.7',21147461,CA,2023/03/15 14:00:03,2023/03/15 14:47:36,Parts-GMA,General,Siebel Administrator,Genesis Email,6937452,7436616,5195983,9400,SCOTT.BRUN,,,,Y,2022 GV70; I need to order a front wiring harness,Referred to the parts department at the Genesis retailer.,SCOTT,

I would appreciate any further help with this .  ,32532080,Low Score 2 & 3 Star Response,"",03/17/2023,03/19/2023,03/19/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,24526491,,Gary,Oakes,,gtoakes@aol.com,,,,,,,2021,Genesis,G80,KMTGB4SC5MU078376,73.245.245.66,9534,,73.245.245.66,'Chrome 111.0.0','Windows 10',21144151,CA,2023/03/15 07:37:32,2023/03/15 07:49:22,Parts - GMA,Pricing,GCCC Care,GCCC Care,24526491,6706253,,,ASHLEY.MARGETIN,,,,Y,GENERAL INQUIRY: Owner seeking paint pen for vehicle,Referred to retailer,ASHLEY,

Both the companies have parts that are unavailable to purchase.  I thought there was a law the forbiding Car Manufacturing companies not having parts available especially an 11 year old car.  I needed a CPU and I can't purchase one from any dealership in So. California.  I purchased a used one on EBAY.  Now the dealerships won't download the VIN Number for my car onto the used CPU.  Thus this forces me to have to get rid of my car.  That makes me very reluctant to purchase another GENESIS nor ANY HYUNDAI car.  I'm very upset with the way HYUNDAI and Genesis are run regarding discontinuance of parts on fairly new cars.

CA723,45755,Tuttle-Click Genesis,Alan Cohen,03/20/2023,n/a,1,,4,4,1,3,6,Thank you for this opportunity to respond.  I was given a claim # 21119037 and never heard back again.  I have had a G80 for 5 years and it has been a great car and never had to do anything other than standard maintenance until now.  The entire wheel cardboard assembly became detached as the car appears to be low to the ground and the bumper has been manually attached back several times in the past.  I decided that since my dealer is now only a Hyundai dealer and only services my 2018 model I thought that it would be a good idea to go to a Genesis dealer for this service and would also allow me to see the new cars as I may be in the market later this year.  I called Irvine Genesis and talked with a Norma Ochoa (?) and she gave me an appointment for the following week but we needed to order the part and prepay for it.  I sent her a photo of what had become detached so she could order only what I need but never could complete the order.  I called 16 (sixteen) times to try to straighten it out but could never get a good response and that is when I contacted Genesis and still never got a response.  The one time I did reach her she did not have a record of the appointment booked.  I have since gone back to Hyundai in Tustin where they looked at what I need and ordered the part which hopefully will get there for my Thursday appointment.   To have only one inept dealer in an affluent area like Orange County Ca. is not a good business model if you want to expand your sales.  Until this incident my probable recommendation regarding the brand would have been a 10 but poor servicing could be a problem.  Thank you. ,32544381,"","",03/19/2023,03/20/2023,03/20/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,16902721,,Alan,Cohen,,acohen1068@aol.com,,,,,,,2018,Genesis,G80,KMHGN4JE1JU245705,98.153.137.122,1d71,,98.153.137.122,'Chrome 111.0.0','Windows 10',21119037,CA,2023/03/09 14:55:34,2023/03/17 10:21:52,Service - Retailer,Treatment,GCCC Care,GCCC Care,16902721,18576366,,,SERGIO.JUAREZ02,Western Region,Genesis Western District 3,CA723,Y,SERVICE COMPLAINT,SUBMITTED CONCERN,SERGIO,

I was so dismayed by your local dealership here in Daytona Beach.  Their voice mail system in the service area is totally non-existent.  According to them no one can retrieve any voice messages left on their system do therefore they never return any calls.  I literally had to drive 15 +/- miles to the dealership to book my appointment.   They also supposedly have only one person who can book service for my Genesis GV80.  That's ridiculous.   I totally understand you only want certified/trained Genesis mechanics working on the vehicles,  however if the service department has even a simple computer system any advisor should be able to book an appointment.

However, I am greatly disappointed in the spasmodic operation of the Genesis Connected Services, which again is not functioning.   This happened a couple of months ago or so, and it took many calls a lots of my time over a couple of weeks before it began to operate on a daily basis.   But last week it went dead again.  I called for help, and the inexperienced agent thought I needed new maps from a third party provider.  What kind of operation is this?   I can't make a connection on Connected Services, nor view the weather forecasts, nor anything else.   I don't need new maps.   I have driven Genesis for 5 years, but the persistent failures of Genesis Connected Services in this  2022 G-90 has me very disappointed and convinced that I am certainly not getting the services I paid full sticker price to receive.

It’s been months since my last contact with the national level. THIS IS NOT ABOUT HUNDAI. THIS IS ABOUT OUR LOCAL DEALERSHIP.  
My local dealer and service center is Gettel Hundai of Sarasota, Fl. They are hard to contact, and seem to want me to leave a message ant every different phone number,  and WAIT for them to call you back-which never occurred. Only after my 4-days of attempting to contact, and my persistence, did the phone receptionist hand carry a note to the service department did they call me back. I purchased the new GV80 last Oct. This is my very first attempt at getting service at my purchasing dealership-and it has been a failure.   
You should look into this dealership who is representing your company. 
Sorry to vent here. But I don’t know who to complain to?

WA702,45660,Genesis Of Everett,Sadjad Ahmadi,04/07/2023,n/a,1,,5,3,3,3,5,"Cars are great. But your dealership and customer service is a disaster! I’m here in WA state, and all the time had issues with Everett dealership. Once they didn’t finish the oil changing service completely and my car started leaking oil in the middle of road and couldn’t drive more. 
Second time because they didn’t have enough technician, and it was one hour before closing, they refused to provide the full oil changing services and they just changed the oil and didn’t check the routine services. However in the final receipt they said they checked which the didn’t. Since the entire process only took 15 minutes! 
Lastly I have engine light check on! I called customer service and scheduled a repair service with this dealership. Later that day dealership called me and said don’t come that day. They only gave me another option for 8 days later and one specific time, otherwise they said we will give you time after 4-5 weeks, without providing a rental car. When I asked if I can drive the car with this engine light on and code P303, they said we don’t know. Just drive it and if fails, call the towing company so they can tow the car to here, but again no rental car. 
I’m not sure how you’re calling this a luxury brand? Being luxurious means everything should be at the best service and quality. Not just that make something fancy, without providing a normal services. Even cheap brands have better services than Genesis in USA. When you go to Toyota, Nissan, Subaru, Lexus, or other brands, they all provide the best services with having rental cars available. Even for oil changing services. But these Gensis dealerships in WA state, are the worse I’ve ever seen. Below the basic level. 

I still have my engine light on, and dealership refused to provide me services till next week. And if I don’t make it in that specific time they said, I have to wait for another 5 weeks! I’m regretting buying this car, because serives and dealerships are below the normal level. Rude people with the most poor services.

,,,Marie Semo,04/13/2023,n/a,2,,3,2,1,3,5,"Service representative quoted me an incorrect price on a new tire to replace my tire that was reported as having a puncture.  The difference was $85 in the price of the tire. She did not inform me until she called to tell me my car was being delivered and if she should use the card on file.  I asked what the total was, and it was close to $500.  That was when she informed me the tire was not $316 it was $399. I could not afford the new tire at $399 and asked if they could waive the $45 installation fee. I was then told the installation fee could not be waived because they had to pay the technician to install it. I told her I could not pay for the tire; I just lost my job and was on a budget. She informed me that they could put my old tire back on and deliver my car back to me, which they did.  So, it's interesting that the installation fee could not be waived but it turned out that the technician installed and uninstalled the tire without the $45.  I love my Genesis, the sales team is amazing and the last time I had my car serviced, it was great. This experience was much different and shocking that no one was willing to work with me. The mistake was made from a Genesis employee, yet I, the customer, was going to have to pay for her mistake. A better outcome would have been to honor the price I was quoted to retain a happy customer.

You are going to have to do a real sell job for me to purchase another when my lease is up in 2024. I have filled out numerous surveys and have yet to have any type of follow up.  Cadillac has the best service in the business from delivery to the service department. I hate the aggravation with this car. My rearview mirror is dangling, my steering wheel doesn't retract or tilt, side mirrors aren't folding in, cold air continually blows thru vents when heat is on, not to mention my app is not functioning. I contacted the dealer closest to my home and the service manager told me that he thinks I wasn't given proper delivery of my vehicle. He suggested it could be operator error. Again, he asked me where I purchased this car from. Who cares and why does it matter? It has a warranty for the duration of my lease.  Please don't call me and leave a voice mail to instruct me to take screenshots of my car running to try and diagnose its issue. If this is such a level of concern, please call me personally. 1.630.363.1790. My husband is a die hard, loyal, Hyundai owner. However, I am still employed, running my own business and have a financial influence regarding the large purchases in our family.

Unfortunately, my experience with dealing with the service department was unfavorable. My engine light came on, which is very alarming to say the least. I contacted the Service Department in Southfield, Mi. to schedule an appointment to bring my  2022 GV80 in to get placed on the diagnostic machine  and was told 1.) I would not be able to bring it in until April 24th, which is 2 weeks out and 2.) a loaner car would not be available for me until June. I asked would Genesis accommodate me by paying for a rental vehicle and I was told, no. I have been driving luxury vehicles for over 20 years and I have never experienced this type of service with any of my luxury vehicles. Although, I love my GV80, I am very disappointed with the service department. This issue will definitely make me reconsider purchasing or leasing another vehicle with Genesis.

Other luxury dealers like Lexus, Mercedes, Infiniti, Acura, etc have made the commitment. Even Consumer reports review seems to be hedging on reliability and commitment. I wanted to know why? see email exchange below.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I guest the dealer where I live is the problem then. I am to assume that they aren’t ready to commit in my area. I guess I will have to wait to buy a genesis when they do. 
Other car dealers have committed. I guess I need to buy cars from them. Thanks for clearing that up for me.

I love my 2019 G90 and the Google GPS is now functional!  

The issue I encountered was regarding the Genesis to Google GPS handshaking.  The GPS stopped working in June, 2022.  No one at Dennis Hyundai seemed to know the issue was software related.  In fact, I was told to ""use the turn signal GPS, it's the same thing as the rear view mirror GPS"".  No, it is not.
Dennis replaced the microphone in the car to see if that would fix the Google GPS problem.  Obviously, there was a widespread communication problem-- either Genesis Corporate did not communicate with Dennis or Dennis did not filter the information properly to its Genesis customers.

,,,Amy Herold,04/20/2023,n/a,1,,5,2,2,4,0,"I called because all of my connected services, satellite connection, and USB connection went out 3 weeks after purchasing my brand new Genesis GV70.  I bought the extended warranty yet was told there was nothing that could be done to fix my car until a software update was released in May that may or may not fix the problem.  I am incredibly disappointed that I purchased a luxury car with the upgraded model and warranty, yet the safety and convenience features that I purchased are broken and unable to be repaired for over a month.  I was told since it doesn't affect safety or driveability that there was nothing that could be done to fix my car until seeing if the software update helps.  Unclear date of update, and unclear if the update would work.  In addition, I would disagree that it is not a safety concern.  On easter I packed up my car with all my belongings and my 3 dogs to head home and one of them stepped on the lock button while my purse was in the car as I was walking around to get in the drivers seat.   The whole car locked down and because there was no connection to the upgraded Genesis Connect features, I was unable to unlock my door with the app and the Genesis representative was unable to unlock the car.  Meanwhile my three dogs are locked inside.  I had to wait an hour for AAA to come help then my car was scratched by the wire used to unlock the doors.  I was grateful he arrived and a scratch is worth it to ensure my dogs aren't locked in the car, but absolutely crazy to me that this happened to a three week old luxury vehicle with 600 miles on it and supposedly under warranty.  I cannot use the navigation in the car or with my phone on apple carplay as neither work, I also can't use the XM satellite radio service I'm paying for.  I'm so incredibly disappointed with the quality and service of Genesis I could cry.  I was very happy with my new car for appx. 3 weeks but am in a loaner now for safety purposes.   The customer service representative was polite when he informed me there was nothing to be done to fix my broken car.",32767998,"","",04/20/2023,04/20/2023,04/20/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,27755672,,Amy,Herold,,ladydoc1@gmail.com,,,,,,,2023,Genesis,GV70,KMUMADTB3PU109068,69.238.162.225,a13a,,69.238.162.225,'Chrome 112.0.0','Windows 10',21283461,CA,2023/04/13 16:52:04,2023/04/18 16:50:57,Product Information,Mapcare,GCCC Care,Genesis Email,27755672,29456077,,,SCOTT.BRUN,,,,Y,MAP UPDATE INQUIRY,two phone call and email no response closing case  will follow up,SCOTT,

So, while I'm extremely disappointed with the level of commitment from the dealership, I'm very pleased with the commitment and professionalism from Genesis Customer Care.",32788991,"","",04/23/2023,04/23/2023,04/23/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,27805388,,Lance,Curry,,lancefinance@gmail.com,,,,,,,2021,Genesis,GV80,KMUHCESC9MU071627,98.97.35.47,75e2,,98.97.35.47,'Safari 16.4','Mac OS X 10.15',21319647,CA,2023/04/21 12:32:05,2023/04/21 13:00:12,Service Link,Schedule Maintenance,GCCC Care,GCCC Care,27805388,23318842,,33123,ANDREW.TEMPLETON,Western Region,Genesis Western District 1,WA702,Y,GENESIS BRAND - GCS SERVICE LINK ASSISTANCE; 2021 GV80; VEH says service is due and would like to schedule an APPT,WA702 WILL BE CONTACTING CUST DIRECTLY TO SCHEDULE - 4/21,ANDREW,

Lots of compliments on it.  Looked like it was doing a 100mph standing still.  I think the GV70 would look even more awesome in a brown!    I gave a 5 on recommendation because I'm 70 and currently living in California foothills and dealerships are over an hour away.  I have read about the drivetrain and electrical issues so I'm concerned about it's reliability.   In my youth I owned a Jaguar XKE and XJS and a Jensen Healy so I know about reliability issues. Ha!   I totalled my vehicle in a snow storm this March so I need something but am still comparing makes.  It will be the last vehicle I buy.  I guess I'm having a difficult time selecting what to get because of that.  Nothing is as beautiful as the GV70 but there's more practical very ugly models with out the reliability issues.

When I asked for LOANER SERVICE because it would take 3-4 days, I asked where I bought the car, asked the manager, and he said no.
When I signed the contract, I heard that all services apply equally at all branches, so I checked and signed the contract.
When I complained about it, I came back after a week with LOANER SERVICE, but the next day I called and said that the service was not available, so I hung up. The reason is that the ownership is different.
Does this make sense? I don't know what kind of ownership you're talking about when a large company called Hyundai does this.
I would never have signed a contract if it was only where the service or warranty was purchased.
As a Korean, I was very proud of Hyundai, a Korean company, and I am very disappointed.
Eventually, I contacted the dealer who bought it, and he said he would contact me after checking the schedule.

,,,Anne Hamlin,04/30/2023,n/a,1,,5,1,1,1,0,"I typed a long explanation and when I tried to ""Submit"", your system locked up.  Your survey system works as well as your Navigation system which does not work.  I don't have the energy to type a detailed explanation, AGAIN, especially not knowing if your survey system will lock up this time as well.  But, suffice it to say that I am absolutely fed up with your Navigation System which is NOT RELIABLE and which takes a dealership to update.  This is the second time in the last year that I have (1) initiated the steps to complete the over the air update; (2) reached out to your Customer Care line for help, to no avail; and (3) had to schedule an appointment with the dealership in order to have the Navigation System update completed.  I will no longer be recommending this vehicle to people who ask how I like my Genesis; instead, I will advise people that if they don't care about Navigation or convenient Concierge Service, this is the car and manufacturer for them.  My Navigation system stopped working on Wednesday of last week when I was in an unfamiliar location.  I used Google Maps on my iPhone, instead.  I spent 2 hours of my own time on Thursday downloading the Navigation update onto a USB drive but was unsuccessful in getting the update to install.  I called and spoke with Destiny at the Customer Care connection.  After she was unable to troubleshoot the problem, she placed me on hold for 30+ minutes while she tried to connect to Technical Assistance.  When no one answered, she assured me she would call back once she could connect the 3 of us on a call.  She followed up on her promise and called me back on Tuesday - a full 5 days after I had initially reached out with the problem.  By that time, I had scheduled a service appointment with the dealership to have the Navigation System Update completed at the dealership.  Destiny told me that Technical Assistance advised her that there was an error in the update system.  This is pathetic and not what I expect of a high-end/luxury car.

I have had a wonderful experience with the Genesis Brand and my Genesis vehicles (my 2017 G90 and my GV80 to date, but I will never visit Genesis of Greer again, in that their efforts were misleading and only aimed at maximizing revenue for the dealership.  I have an 868 credit rating, yet Genesis of Greer personnel put me into a loan that I did not even want (I had a checkbook to buy the new car outright) at 7.65% interest when their website advertised 4.99 and 5.99% offers.  They also told me to keep the loan for 6 months and one day before cancelling (which would have generated nearly $2,000 interest).  When I read the loan papers, it was clear that there was no prepayment penalty, so I paid off the loan already.  Interestingly, I asked for the date representing 6 months from the loan origination, and the sales person gave me one date, and the loan manager gave me a different date, 30 days later (which would have generated an additional $250 or so in interest.  Additionally, I drove the car I bought on 4/1 a total of One hundred nine miles before it was returned to the dealer exchange for the Premier model with soft close doors.  This was because my wife and granddaughter could not close the doors without several tries.  I needed soft close doors.  As close as I can discern from the paperwork for the two purchases, it cost me over $14,000 to return a car I had only driven 109 miles.

I had contacted Genesis about My Genesis Intelligent Assistant app, which has not communicated with my GV80 for nearly 3 months.  I got an email with step by step instructions for a ""head unit reset"", which I appreciate.  But the instructions don't explain what happens when I do the reset.  Do I lose some or all of my presets?  That would be good to know.  The email from Genesis also mentioned a recall to fix seat belt pretensioners, and advised that I schedule a service appointment, mentioning my case number when I schedule.  But the email does not include a link I can use to go right to service scheduling. That would be nice to have. I love my GV80 and I consider Genesis a high-value, premium brand.  Unfortunately, I find lots of little things intended to enhance the vehicle ownership experience--issues with the app; challenges with service and support--which do not match the high quality and attention to detail I see on Genesis (and Hyundai company vehicles--my wife has a 2022 Tucson Hybrid).",32838222,Low Score 2 & 3 Star Response,"",04/30/2023,04/30/2023,04/30/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,22596935,,Kevin,Mcdonald,,kevinmcdonald1@roadrunner.com,,,,,,,2021,Genesis,GV80,KMUHBDSBXMU052833,23.242.160.184,5a64,,23.242.160.184,'Chrome 112.0.0','Windows 10',21346845,CA,2023/04/27 11:10:07,2023/04/28 10:25:54,Remote Services,Functionality Concerns,Siebel Administrator,Genesis Email,22596935,24216697,,18207,DUSTIN.CHEMERIKA,,,,Y,REMOTE SERVICES TROUBLESHOOTING; My Genesis Intelligent Assistant app has not updated in nearly three months.

,,,Michael Roth,04/30/2023,n/a,4,,4,3,2,3,8,"The first person to answer was very courteous, but could not help me. I was then connected to someone else to answer my warranty question. They were as helpful as possible, but I guess my situation was very unusual. 
1. I wanted to see (either on the website or in print) exactly what my warranty was on the CPO G90 I had just bought. I have been told by my salesperson (who I credit with trying several times) and then by your customer care person, that I cannot receive a personalized copy or any exact copy of the coverage that I have. This is very difficult for me to comprehend because I received just exactly that when I bought my last CPO Genesis. It spelled out in detail exactly what was covered and what was not. The Genesis support person was able to send me a copy of a contract for someone else for a different car from 3 years ago. Is that really all that is available? The Genesis warranty would seem to me to be a very strong selling point and I would think that it should be readily available to potential buyers as well as to those who have already bought. 
2. After several inquiries for the CPO info, the dealership produced a brief electronic coversheet with the CPO contract number. However, the contract was in the name of ""Melissa Roth."" My name is ""Michael Roth."" My salesperson's first name was Melissa. Evidently, whoever processed the contract in the back office mixed those two names together. Your Genesis support person told me that the original CPO contract must now be canceled and a new one submitted by the dealer in my correct name. Like I said, this has probably never come up before. So I understand that it could not be handled quickly. But that is the reason I gave the ratings of 2 and 3, not because the support person was inept.

When I got my vehicle to the service center, he refused to speak with me. However, Scott was great, & I felt taken care of & like a priority.

The repairs were finished much earlier than I expected & was told, sobI was very happy about that.

,,,Matt Landes,05/06/2023,n/a,1,,1,1,1,1,0,"I am not willing to renew my subscription because of the security and privacy concerns that lead me to opening ticket 20698273. I view a decision to refuse to support me until I pay for a service that you won’t assure me is safe and private as an absolute slap in the face. I opened this ticket MONTHS ago, was never given any status update on it despite me calling and asking multiple times. The closest I got was “we will let you know” and the first I hear back since at least January is this call and email. To come back to me all these months later and demand money or you won’t address the issue that is the very reason I won’t renew would be the height of comedy if it wasn’t tied to my car and basic features I was told my vehicle shipped with. This whole process is absolutely unacceptable. Can you legitimately look at this and say this is a “premium” experience, because your certainly trying to charge me like it is. 

I was excited when I got my Genesis, coming from BMW and Lexus historically, and totally bought into the idea your dealers sold me that you were different from the more established marques. I like it so much that I also bought my wife a Hyundai! What I didn’t understand until now that you also meant different in the sense of not following through or standing by your product. You’re certainly not different when it comes to demonstrating how little you value your customers outside of their wallets. 

I cannot believe the disrespect and callous nature of this service. I sincerely expected better. This interaction makes me want to completely step away from cars I otherwise love. If this is an experience you standby, then I intend to let everyone know what they can expect and Genesis and Hyundai are no longer brands I will be able to support. 

I would NEVER have bought this car if I knew the experience that was in store for me. 

Sincerely,

The Genesis Care representative said that 3 year valet service was only available for maintenance, and that I'd have to bring my car into the dealer for service - EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A $100+ CAR THAT CAME WITH ISSUES.   She was apologetic and put me on hold while she contacted the dealer's service department to see if they'd make an exception.  They would not.  Further, even though the  Genesis Care rep said that I'd be entitled to a loaner car if the repairs took time,  she was advised by the dealer's rep that they do not have loaner cars.   Finally, the Genesis Care rep said I should consider trying the other Houston Genesis dealer to see if I'd get a better result.  Bottom line, the Genesis Care rep did what she could, but the Genesis dealer's response was inadequate.  Part of Genesis' and the dealer's marketing pitches was the high level of service compared to other luxury cars.   But, friends with BMW's, Mercedes, and Audi's in the same general price range all said this was far below the level of service they received for new cars with issues.  Hence, my ""5"" rating on recommending the Genesis brand to friends/colleagues - the car is great, the buying experience was great, but the service just isn't.

Though the driving experience is rewarding I am disappointed in some of the other aspects of service; mainly having to address the issues to begin with.  My fingerprint recognition never worked and took over 6 months and several trips to the service dealer for correction.  It took me filing a complaint with USA Genesis for the issue to be resolved.   This time my navigation ceases to work and I am informed an upgrade is necessary; 1 day after I had my vehicle in for service at an authorized Genesis dealer.  I contacted Genesis Connect and the representative gave me a couple of options, but couldn’t tel me if my vehicle had an SD card or USB port for updating the navigation.  After figuring it out myself the navigation still would not register/work.  I contacted Genesis Connect yet again and even though the representative was very polite and courteous, she could not remedy the problem and had to submit a “ticket” and someone would call me.  It’s been 5 days and I have not received a callback from someone to assist me.  I am also very disappointed in the advertised “Genesis Concierge Service” when purchasing a new Genesis.  Not only is it non-existent, but the dealer doesn’t provide a loaner vehicle nor shuttle service to and from home/work.  I  would rather take my vehicle to my local service garage for service and pay the bill out of my pocket than continue to use the “authorized dealer” for covered maintenance.

The last call was to tell me to install an update which took well over an hour and seemed to be directed at electric cars. This did not fix the problem. 
I called the dealership and I am taking the car in Tuesday. If they cannot fix the voice recognition problem I will have nothing but bad things to say about Genesis. I will continue to buy Lexus. 
We are so disappointed in the customer service. Every time I have spoken to someone they run me through the same steps to no avail. They are clearly not equipped to handle problems. 
I asked to have an engineer call me and they said they did not call customers. Really this is your idea of “ our customer service exceeds your expectations “

Unfortunately I have had the same experience scheduling service and now scheduling a recall appointment. since I purchased the vehicle in November 2021. The Genesis Connect person could not reach Las Vegas Genesis to schedule an appointment and it took over 5 days the first appointment and an hour and a half being on the phone with the very curtious Genesis Connect representative before I finally got an appointment. The Genesis GV70 is an exceptional vehicle that unfortunately has a Hyundai dealership that has no concern for the customer. I have owed a lot of luxury cars and have never had a dealership that I had to use as poorly run as Las Vegas Hyundai/Genesis. I purchased the vehicle at Santa Monica Genesis which was spectacular in every way and now i have to deal with a dealership that is the worst I have used. I will be dumping my GV70 very soon and doing everything in my power to discourage anyone I know not to purchase a Genesis in Las Vegas.
I am available to discuss this if you wish at 702 278-6229

They never have loaner cars when turning or getting service.

I used the app to cancel the service on 5/13/23 or 5/14/23 before the subscription services were renewed. On 5/18/23, I noticed my bank account was charged $19.80. I called Genesis to explain that they had charged my bank and I had already tried to cancel the service through the app, but they still charged my account. Please go into the account and shut this service off for the Summer months. The Genesis representative on the phone said she couldn't because it was under my wife's name and I wasn't on the account. I explained again that I turned it on through the app and turned it off through the app, please make sure this is disconnected! Again, she said she couldn't! This is worse than working with the cable company!! I got the supervisor and explained the situation again. I went into the app while the supervisor was on the phone and canceled it AGAIN! She explained that she could see that it was canceled, but since the account was ""auto renewal"" it would take a couple of days for the refund to come through. Today is 5/24/23 and my account is still showing active through the subscription. My bank account still has not been credited back. This type of service of holding your customers captive in a subscription is infuriating! This is poor customer care over $20 a month!! Look at this from a customer's perspective.

,,,Robert Drewes,05/21/2023,n/a,4,,5,5,5,5,5,"Genesis CC confirmed dealer's information regarding recall 012G requiring an evaluation at dealer. Depending of results dealer would order recall parts if necessary requiring ANOTHER dealer visit.. Ridiculous that the dealer does not stock parts necessary for a safety recall repair. Semi Pro at best, not to mention that the 1st appointment will be one month out.  So...if this is a safety recall I must wait a month to find out if it affects my car? and some number of additional days to resolve? Kind of a bad joke IMO.  Really hope shrapnel metal doesn't explode in my face. I don't plan on having an accident but one never knows when it can happen to you.
Up til now Genesis has been top notch.

The service appointment had been set up previously by another rep. I called to confirm it and was told that even though I had a confirmation email, the dealership indicated that they had no record of any appointment for me.  Ariana called the dealership and was unable to speak with a service advisor to confirm the service appointment.  In fact, what she learned was that there was no appointment on the calendar. At that point she promised to call the dealership on Friday, confirm my appointment or secure another, and to call to let me know no later than 4pm PT. To date, I have no confirmed appointment and have not heard from Genesis about one. I cannot fully express my utter disappointment and frustration with the service provided.

I wasted untold hours on the phone that should have been spent working in my company, yet the problem was never resolved.  When I take the car in for service, the service I get is so bad that I've begun taking it to my personal mechanic and paying for repairs even when the work should be warrantied.  The service department never provides a rent car, I have to book an appointment at LEAST a week in advance and the car never is done when it's promised.

,,,Walter Saunders,05/28/2023,n/a,2,,1,1,1,1,3,"I live in Reno, Nevada. Just over 100 miles away from the closest Genesis dealership in Roseville, CA. I am associated with many friends and family at the Hyundai dealership in Reno. I bought the GV70 because Genesis makes a fantastic car. Several weeks after having it, the drivetrain went out while I was on the highway. It was quite scary. Little did I know that wasn't going to be the worst of it. It was a nightmare getting it fixed. While purchasing my vehicle, I specifically asked about valet due to intense work and school (doctoral program). I was assured it would be no problem. That would turn out to be a lie. The person who answered most of my calls at Roseville (female) was rude and condescending each time I spoke with her over the few years I had the vehicle. Service people were slightly better, but not by much.

I had the GV70 for about eighteen months and loved the ride and comfort. It was time for it to be serviced. I traditionally paid for my oil changes through Lithia Hyundai as I dreaded dealing with Roseville Genesis. However, this service could not be avoided because of a recall and a significant service appointment. I made the valet appointment on the Genesis Connect app for a week out. Genesis Roseville rescheduled it for an additional week through the app. Not a problem as everyone gets busy. The night before the appointment, I get a call from my service advisor stating Genesis doesn't drive to where I live. Next time, please don't use the app as it doesn't account for distance, call the dealership. Wait, what? So you are saying not to use Genesis technology? I mentioned it wasn't a problem when they sold me the vehicle and drove it Reno/Carson City, and they assured me the courtesy would extend to when I owned the vehicle. The service manager stated, ""We normally would meet you have way, like over Truckee or something, and exchange for a loaner."" What type of shady practice is that? He stated, ""We only have to go 50 miles."" 

Finally, he agreed to retrieve my vehicle for service and stated it was too long of a drive to get it back the same day and I would have it the next. Not a problem, as I was grateful. I got it back several days later, but again, things happen. The check engine light came on within several days as I was driving to work. I contacted Genesis Connect. They said they would contact Roseville and have someone call me immediately when they opened. The hours rolled by with no call, and I was extremely nervous about driving my vehicle with the check engine light on and previous drive train failure. I contacted Genesis Connect. They are very nice people. They stated they were still waiting to get a hold of someone in Roseville. Finally, I called Roseville after waiting 8 or so hours from my first call to Genesis Connect. I was told rather curtly, ""We received the call from Genesis Connect this morning, set up a tow if you are worried about it."" They would not drive the vehicle either. I informed them I could not afford a rental while this was being worked on. They informed me, ""I don't know what to tell you."" First off, if your received the call from Genesis Connect in the morning, why didn't you call me back and make me wait all day? Genesis Connect apologized to me profusely for Roseville going so far as to state even they had previous and current difficulties working with that particular dealership. 

I immediately sold my GV70. One of my life's most painful experiences was dealing with Roseville Genesis and letting go of my dream car. I went back into a Hyundai Santa Fe. This experience has led to me having about $17,000 in negative equity and, with the current interest rates, a less enjoyable current vehicle which is more expensive than my previous GV70. I immediately contacted Genesis of Las Vegas to see my options for a G70, and I would pay out of pocket to have Lithia Hyundai service the vehicle. Sadly the economy is not going to allow for this. It is unfortunate Genesis did not work to continue allowing its product to be sold and serviced at Lithia Reno as many of us own Genesis vehicles. Lithia would drive across the state for its customers. I have known their GM and their sales department for almost a decade and I live with one so I know. More unfortunate that I am not the only one who had a continuous nightmare with Roseville Genesis. Roseville Genesis made my life so difficult which could have resulted in loss of employment due to no vehicle, but not their problem as they made the sale under false pretenses. They surely were not there for my service needs or even for basic customer service. It will take me years to dig out of the financial hole this has caused me.",32978375,Low Score 2 & 3 Star Response,"",05/24/2023,05/28/2023,05/28/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,14560913,,Walter,Saunders,,waltersaunders972@yahoo.com,,,,,,,2022,Genesis,GV70,KMUMCDTC5NU038780,71.94.88.137,4f59,,71.94.88.137,'Firefox 113.0.','Windows 10',21377742,CA,2023/05/04 07:12:39,2023/05/22 07:15:08,Service Link,DTC,GCCC Care,GCCC Care,14560913,15768608,4697181,,ASHLEY.MARGETIN,,,,Y,GENESIS BRAND - GCS SERVICE LINK ASSISTANCE,Reached out to retailer and owner regarding valet concern for engine light. referred retailer to speak to owner directly and advised owner to speak to retailer.   engine light: valet agreemen,ASHLEY,

,,,Mary Lopez,05/28/2023,n/a,1,,4,3,4,3,3,The genesis rep scheduled for my car to get diagnosed because the camera on the turn signal does not work and the dashboard info is not working either. When I got to the dealership Ruby informed me that they do not service cars on Saturday and that the service techs would not be in until June 20th. I scheduled my entire day around this service appointment. It was a waste of time and gas which is not cheap. Also come to find out that if my car would have been serviced I would not have had a loner car to use. When I bought the car the finance manager specifically told me that I would have valet service when ever my new genesis needed service. I’m upset because I was miss I formed on the valet service so you should honor what I was promised and I’m upset because I’m paying too dollar for this car and it is not working correctly and now I have to wait for the techs to be back until June.

,,,Paul Troup,06/01/2023,n/a,1,,3,1,1,1,0,"Genesis Customer care and Genesis USA are poorly organized and lack leadership. They don't respond to customer issues in a meaningful way even after repeated phone calls.  They do not assist or reproach dealerships with substandard performance.  There is now only one Genesis dealership in Birmingham and other Hyundai dealers are no longer servicing Genesis vehicles for reasons unclear to consumers. The next closest servicing dealership is 58 miles waya at Tuscaloosa, Al.  This has led to a volume overload at the service department of Jim Burke Genesis service department, delays of weeks getting service, no loaner vehicles when vehicle is in the shop unless the customer pays for a rental and then has to beg Genesis for reimbursement.  What happened to concierge service?  I have been trying to get an extended service contract quote from two genesis dealerships in Birmingham and Tuscaloosa and I have not received a single return call from either despite leaving 4-6 voicemails at the finance manager and service managers phones  In the meantime my factory warranty has likely expired.  Genesis customer service recommended I contact Safeguard (888)-477-9771 and when I did so they told me extended warranties have to be obtained through dealerships, not Safeguard, putting me right back where I started. Why didn’t Genesis Customer Service have the correct vendor contact me directly? I really like my car, but dealing with Genesis USA customer service and the local dealerships are more than I bargained for.  When I leased (and later purchased) my car I had to do it at an Irvine, California dealership because I could not strike a deal with the local dealerships (there were more here then) and it was still less expensive for me to have the car shipped from LA to Birmingham, than to do the deal locally. I will not lease or buy another Genesis automobile unless the problems outlined above have been corrected.  There were problems in 2018 when I leased the vehicle, but they have apparently gotten even worse since then. You many respond to this feedback in any way you choose

There are no Lexus dealers on the coast and the closest dealer is in Portland. Rather than have me drive 100 miles each way I was instructed to contact the Toyota dealer 20 miles away.  Genesis is to Hyundai what Lexus is to Toyota. I'll remember this when I purchase my next car.

The AC blows lukewarm air and living in Houston, Texas where's it's 90+ degrees in the shade, it's not doable so the car isn't drivable.  It's sitting in the garage, waiting for my appt.  I called all 4 Genesis dealers in the Houston Metroplex and there wasn't an earlier service date.  It was explained there's limited Genesis certified service professionals and thus the wait.  Why is that my issue?  

In full transparency, I wouldn't have traded in my Mercedes SUV if I knew I couldn't drive my Genesis for blocks of time.

I asked Customer Service for a loaner while I'm waiting for my car to be serviced and they said ""no"".  I asked for a rental car and they said they didn't know if it would be reimbursed and I asked if they could transfer me to the dept. that makes those decisions and they said they couldn't.  

MY NEXT STEP IF I DON'T HEAR POSITIVELY BACK FROM Y'ALL IS TO POST MY CONCERNS ON SOCIAL MEDIA.  I'M ASKED OFTEN IF I LIKE MY CAR AND NOW MY ANSWER IS ""NO AS IT IS TOO DIFFICULT TO SERVICE"".  
Happy to talk to someone ""live"" who can make a positive decision.

,,,Kathleen Carney,06/07/2023,n/a,3,,5,3,3,1,2,"My issue with Genesis is twofold.
1.) We purchased our 2022 G70 from Genesis of Cool Springs that was several months old, with 3400 miles, yes classified as a used vehicle. Understood.  BUT, as was represented by the dealership, we believed we had the remainder of the full warranty and services related to Genesis owners.  I did not pay much attention to any of it until the 'rough road, be careful' alert from hell epidemic ensued. That is when we realized how difficult it was to join the Genesis Family in the hopes of reconciling this issue.  I think it is easier to join the Gambino Family. The last rep Araianna did a great job. It was difficult and frustrating to that point.   
2.) No one locally or at Genesis seems to know how to fix a goofy error message, this gives me pause.  Such a sophisticated car with such a feeble remedy for such a small problem.
More than a month of listening to the constant dinging.
I love the car, but I won't be buying another.

He said i needed a map upgrade and gave me a phone number to call; I did but with no success. I have tried numerous time to call my local dealer Key Genesis of Milford with absolutely no success! If you get an answer they transfer the call and it goes no where. I finally drove to the dealership last Friday and was directed to talk with the service manager, Alex Zapata. Mr. Zapata said they their phone system was very bad. He also told me the problem I described was not uncommon and that the map upgrade (because it is somehow connected with the computer system) should fix the problem. He told me the upgrade was not covered under the warranty, but he personally would install the upgrade. He said he would call me Monday or Tuesday (today). I did not hear back from him and once again could not get through on the phone. I drove to the dealership again today and was told that Mr. Zapata was not available. a service writer, who was very nice, took my name and number and said he would ask Mr. Zapata to call me. I did not hear back. This is my second Genesis having owned  several Mercedes before. I very much like my current 2023 GV70 3.5TS and have in the past been very happy with the help I have received from connected services when I had problems with electronic issue. GCS was able to do a re-boot while I was in my car with them on the phone. Unfortunately GCS was unable to correct the problem. My Voice Command and Phone Connection stopped working, this is very inconvenient. Any help you, GCS can provide will be greatly appreciated.

All the questions above - are absolutely irrelevant to WHY I had to call support that day.
I was explained by the technician the the reason that connected services was disconnected is because I did not use the mobile application for a few days… really ? I need to remind my car not to forget about my existence ?? Really ???

This is happened to me for the second time in a couple of weeks
I will call you headquarters and vocalize my piece of mind.. and they are not going to like it
And NO

,,,Charles Baker,06/11/2023,n/a,4,,4,4,4,4,8,"The agent was great.  But I'm angry and I'll explain why.  I have called Genesis Customer Care multiple times asking when I'd receive OTA updates for our two 2023 GV70 Sport Prestige.  It wasn't until this call anyone told me, we needed to accept OTA updates through some link (which by the way, is broken and doesn't work at all).  In fact, the Genesis Owners Home page rarely works.  It hasn't worked all weekend.  How can a company who builds cars as great as these cars have such bad systems supporting their customers?  How?  I'd really love an answer.

Now to why I'm really angry.  When I got in my car yesterday, all radio stations, my iPhone pairing, and all settings were simply wiped away.  I had to repair my phone, reset all radio stations, reset all settings to my preferences, reenter my passcode, reenter my finger print.  This took a lot of work.  And today, I read on one of my Genesis Forums, this happened to a LOT of people.  I mean A LOT OF PEOPLE.  

Why?  How could our cars simply be wiped clean of all connections and settings?  Why didn't anyone from Genesis let us know something was being worked on and let us know what we could do to prevent the total wipeout of our cars settings?  Besides not being able to log into the Genesis Owners Page, I've been trying to accept the ability to receive over the air updates for a couple days now.   Why is it so ridiculously difficult to get the ability to get OTA updates to begin with?  My 2019 Mercedes E450 got them without issue and I never had to sign into some non-functioning page to accept them.  As long as I was connected to Mercedes Me Services, my car got updates.  To be honest, I adore my car, but your systems access leaves beyond a lot to desire.  I'm IT Recruiter by profession, I'd be happy to help you hire programmers who won't mess up half your customer base.  

I want someone from Genesis to reach out to me and explain why I along with hundreds (possibly thousands) of owners had the systems in our cars simply wiped of all settings?

I want to know why its so unbelievably difficult to accept getting over the air updates.  It should simply be automatic and not this hard to get.

Again, someone from Genesis needs to reach out to me.  This was simply unacceptable.  Genesis owes a personal apology to EVERYONE whose car was messed up to the point they had to reset everything possible in them.  And honestly, Genesis should compensate us for the multiple hours it took to reset everything.  This was a really BAD experience, which I'm sure could have been completely avoided.  You need to do better.  You really do.

I purchased my second Genesis at Chapman in Scottsdale, Az. They  have since closed as well as the Jim Click dealership in Tucson.  I called the customer service number three times and was promised a call back from a dealer in Gilbert. The call never came. I was led to believe I would drive half way and swap cars because of the distance. The final resolution is that I must drive to San Tan for the repair at a Hyundai/Genesis dealer. Why is it that I am unable to have the work done at a local Hyundai dealer?
As you can well imagine, this will be my last Genesis.

,,,Paul Yonemura,06/19/2023,n/a,4,,5,5,4,4,8,"I own a GV60.  I also belong to the FaceBook Genesis GV60 USA page.  Through that page, I’m getting a lot of information, including potential problems (a lot of people are reporting 12 volt battery failures, plus there have been reports of rear half-shaft failures overseas, that there might be a recall on those), and many positives of owning a GV60.  Your representative was good, but he didn’t know about any of these issues and was surprised that I did.  I told him about the page.  

I do an exceptional amount of reading up on whatever I wind up buying to drive, plus now there are all of the YouTube videos for my car that have proven helpful.  It may be asking a lot, but your customer care reps should be familiar with all of these tools.  It will make them more responsive to customer needs, particularly “finicky” customers,  like me.  I don’t know everything about the GV60, but I’m up on enough things to the point where I felt I knew more about the car than the rep did.  I feel that should be the other way around, but then this has been a problem with dealing with me.  I’ve always known more about the car I buy than most of the sales people and after-care people do.  I will say that so far, the service people working on the car (Dublin Genesis and Roseville Genesis) were good on filling in the gaps for me, particularly with the recent safety belt recall notice (which the FB GV60 group knew was coming months before it actually happened).  

This is a very nice car.  I’d like to see Genesis get to the level of more established luxury brands, when it comes to customer service.  My experiences so far have been good, but reviews from other customers tell me that there’s a lot of improvement needed.  Moving your dealers out of the Hyundai banner is a good first step.  The GV60 and other Genesis models deserve the best, if they’re going to run with “the big dogs,” including Lexus, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW.  I hope someone actually reads this and doesn’t disregard it.",33125187,"","",06/14/2023,06/19/2023,06/19/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,25869075,,Paul,Yonemura,,pyonemura@comcast.net,,,,,,,2023,Genesis,GV60,KMUKCDTC1PU002983,73.189.87.23,ba2c,,73.189.87.23,'Safari 16.5','Mac OS X 10.15.7',21567330,CA,2023/06/12 15:17:21,2023/06/12 15:42:47,Product,Model Information,GCCC Care,GCCC Care,25869075,27602655,,,TIMOTHY.WAGONER,,,,Y,2023 GV60 EV INQUIRY- owner noticed 2 days ago it deleted every thing from their vehicle,Informed owner we are aware of the concern and investigating it.,TIMOTHY,

Wait time was 45+ mins to talk to representative.

None of this was her fault. She was terrific.   Customer representatives should have an operational briefing after clocking in and before talking to any customers.

,,,Eric Weaver,06/19/2023,n/a,1,,3,1,1,1,4,"Genesis Worldwide Genesis USA Genesis G90 Owners Today I had the most disappointing experience with Genesis. I woke up to my doors being locked with the key in my brief case in the rear seat. I never locked the doors. I turned to the Genesis App to unlock the doors. After 6 hours of trying and failing, I called Genesis Customer Care. I nice woman read a script to me explaining that their system was having “connectivity issues” and while apologizing said there was nothing she could do. She suggest I contact roadside asssitance. Never offering the number or to connect me - I disconnected the call and called back to the Genesis Customer Care number. The first option was for Roadside Assistance which I selected. I was greeted with “the number you have dialed is not in service” - clearly I thought this must be in error, so I tried the number several more times with the same result. 

Finally, I called the Genesis Customer Care representative who explained that they were having “connectivity issues” with Roadside Assistance and suggested I call my insurance carrier for help. 

After spending nearly $100k on a vehicle THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. My car is a 2022 and under warranty. I got 3 years of “free”
“Customer Care” for which they would charge me in year 4. My other car is a BMW for which my ownership experience has been FLAWLESS. 

The result: after asking to speak with a supervisor the rep miraculously found a way to contact me with roadside assistance. AAA did a wonderful job. 

I love my Genesis G90, but the purchase and support of ownership experience is pathetic!!

Twice we have been on an interstate driving when all of a sudden factory reset kicks in.  Moving the drivers seat!   All too often the screen and steering wheel freeze up.  Only recourse is to pull over.  Turn the car off.  And pray things will work (for a while) when we restart the car.

This cumbersome and over technically complex procedure requires the customer to: (1) download the installer program to their computer; (2) download the map files; (3) obtain a thumb drive; (4) reformat the thumb drive; (5) plug it in and and then download the new data. Recommend that you guys:  (1) figure out how to install the update over the air, or (2) as an absolute minimum, send your customers a thumb drive with the new data on it, requiring only that they plug it into the car receptacle to install. 

Note: when the Nav system failed, it was absolutely useless and the local dealer - Genesis of Naples, has a waiting time for appointments of weeks, including important recall repairs.  I made an appointment to have a seatbelt recall job done - the dealer cancelled the appointment informing that they do not have the parts on hand - and suggesting that I call later sometime, to see if the parts have come in!

,,,Karin Morris,06/23/2023,n/a,4,,4,4,4,4,8,"There appears to be a disconnect between the Genesis Customer Care team and the dealerships.  In a previous issue a representative called me to follow-up then notified me of a recall.  She set up an appointment of me, but when I called the dealership a few days before the appointment, the dealership had no record and accused the Genesis Customer Care service to be be separate from the dealerships.  The Genesis Customer Care rep put me on hold to schedule the appointment so I know it was done.  I then tried to speak with the Service Manager at the dealership, which took several follow-up calls over a couple of weeks.  After confirming there was no appointment, he then told me that there was a major issue between Genesis and their dealership that is preventing them from adequately servicing Genesis vehicles and providing loaners.  Way too much information for me, and honestly, I found it to be inappropriate although I can understand how frustrated he was.  In the end, he pointed me to another Genesis dealership in the area (further away).  I called there and could not get an appointment for over 2 MONTHS!  The staff at that dealership was less than helpful.  I felt like I was a burden and he was just doing his job.  Very blatantly ambivalent.  Possibly overworked, but not my issue.  As a Genesis owner, we are sold on getting extras service since Genesis is a luxury brand.   That is not happening.  No valet service.  At the first dealership, betting a loaner was close to impossible.  I am gathering it is worse now with the issues between the dealership and Genesis.  I love my car, but the service is not good.   

The most recent call to Genesis Customer Care was not as good as the first.  She was nice, but didn't seem interested in what I was saying.  Part of my call's purpose was to figure out what the app was saying needed to be serviced because I had completed the 2 oil changes per the mileage requirements, but it still showed an outstanding service.  Did not get that resolved, but did get instructions on updating something relative to this in my car.  I am not expecting over the top service, but as a luxury brand, the Customer Care Service was presented as a nice perk.  Not so much.

About 6 weeks ago I made an appointment at Bob Baker for service on my 2021 Genesis G80. After I made the appointment, and prior to the day of the appointment, Autonation purchased Bob Baker Carlsbad and no longer services Genesis. No one at Autonation reached out to advise me my service appointment was no longer possible at that dealership. I only found out when I drove in the morning of the appointment. An employee there told me staff reductions made by Autonation made it impossible to contact those now abandoned customers. I have scheduled service at Genesis of Escondido, and I expect that to go smoothly. I do not expect Genesis to fix what was broken by Autonation.  But I sure hope Genesis thinks twice before allowing Autonation to participate with the Genesis name in the future. Autonation is not demonstrating they care about customer service.

Disconnected or hung up more than once!

I was trying to find out if I could get a HARD COPY brochure of the 2023 Genesis GV70.

I must have called 3-4 different phone numbers and could not get a satisfactory YES or NO.

Did you know you have a dealer in Florida whose name is ""GENESIS HEADQUARTERS""?  I even called them, and it took a couple of minutes to sink in it was NOT Genesis Headquarters!

I presently drive a Genesis G70 I plan on replacing with the GV70.  My daughter drives a G80 that she plans on replacing with another G80.

It is a good thing I/we like your cars because your customer service leaves much to be desired!!!!

I was going to purchase the SELECT package but after reading the digital version of the brochure I believe I should have selected the Advanced package.  Too late now since my GV70 Select will be arriving the end of July and I am not going to cancel that order and wait another couple of months to get what I really want.

The Genesis dealer in Plano Texas and in particular the salesman I have been working with (Jon Kan) are GREAT.  If it was not for their professionalism I probably would have gone to Audi for my next car (Avant Allroad).
