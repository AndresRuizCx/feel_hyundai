Also, check the recording out if you want to (you guys say my call will be recorded and monitored), but when I gave a feedback lack of a communication regarding the system being wiped ~1 month ago out of nowhere, without any notice, and no ""sorry for your inconvenience, this happened because of A, and we are trying B to resolve this"" kind of email, she NEVER SAID sorry for your inconvenience or any term of apology. 

Now about Genesis, not Monica, lack of communication (like I mentioned above) is a HUGE problem of Genesis, while you are advertising as a new luxury brand.

I called the next nearest Genesis dealership (Genesis of Bel Air, MD) to have a recall notice serviced and they would not valet pick up my car for the service. Thankfully, Jessyca was able to locate a dealership (Genesis of West Chester, PA) that would valet my car for the required safety recall. Hopefully I will continue to be able to receive the valet service from this dealership, or I may have to sell the car. It’s unfortunate, as I was considering purchasing a Genesis as my next vehicle. Without convenient access to a dealership, it makes it less likely. It’s actually one of the reasons why I came to Genesis from Range Rover. Range Rover of Harrisburg, PA also discontinued valet service and that prompted me to sell my Range Rover to buy from Genesis.

My luxury (?) car made of plastic?  and cheap plastic that falls apart!  Very difficult for me to believe.  I will have owned this car for two years in September and it is falling apart.  I did not expect that!  I don't think that the dealership/Genesis supply chain is working well and the dealership seems to have problems with personnel.  My next concern is if they have the color of the part correct.  The color of the vehicle is ""Siberian Ice"", which I pointed out to the tech waiting on me when I brought it in and he said that the paint shop would look at the vin # to ensure correct color would be used yet the receipt for repair shows color blue!

I really love Genesis and love my G70.  Hoping that the service experience can get to be like Lexus soon and not in this odd Hyundai service stuff.  Its not terrible but not special either.  Id pay the premium for the preium service.  

Also if there is a way i currently purchase a premium service package  on my cpo g70 and have the full 1st class Genius care i will gladly pay.  If i should just buy a new g70 or g80 to have this im cool with that too.  Please let me know if any options are available

But, when I arrived, the waiting room was totally full, and many people were sitting outside in the Houston heat. There was angry shouting from upset customers as I was trying to check in.

When I purchased my 2021 G80 I was excited to drive a very well made car.  Unfortunately the dealership in Concord did not explain all  the technology the car has to offer.  The purpose of my call was to get help with my navigation that has not worked properly for at least 6 months.  I asked the Keffer dealership to please upgrade it.  I was told they could not due to timing and the driver was already bringing my car back to me.  What I found out he was still at the dealership going through the car wash.  Frustrating ....now I have to contact  another company to send me a fob to insert in my car for updating.  I just wish I could spend time with someone who can teach me all the technology that I am not able to use.  I am 74  , drive the car, use the air heat and radio.  Thats it.

MD705,45770,Genesis Of Bel Air,Christopher Haley,07/10/2023,n/a,2,,3,3,1,2,6,"Hello - I thought I had scheduled a recall visit with the BelAir MD Genesis/Hyundia dealership/shop for today at 730am with Genesis Customer Care a week or more ago - and upon arrival this morning at the BelAir location I was told there was NO reservation under my name.  Additionally, the Genesis Customer Care representative I spoke with then indicated that the time allocated for the 2 recall repairs/replcaements would be ~2-3 hours, though this morning the BelAir technician-service lead said the time needed to allocate is closer to 6 hours!  So mis-information and no scheduling.  To add, after leaving the BelAir MD location - after being told I had no reservation - I called Genesis Customer Care @820am this morning - and the lady helping was nice on the phone yet indicated that she apologized for the scheduling inconvenience, and would be emailing me with available times to go to another Genesis dealer (Owings Mills MD) - and I am still waiting for scheduling options to be emailed to me (currently 440pm EST).  I was also told by the BelAir MD technician-service lead that the recall work I need to have done for my car could be done at any other location - which is different from what the 1st Genesis Customer Care lady told me last week or the prior week.  I am increasingly questioning what is the value of the Genesis Customer Care department

I did not receive the follow up as to what was happening, but i did get an email from Vancouver Genesis saying my appointment was still scheduled for the 5th of July at 9am. However they again called and rescheduled for August 15th now. I have a feeling this will be rescheduled again, for the 4th appointment. This is no fault of corporate, but i have no idea how i could recommend the brand to anyone else given my location and the treatment our only local dealership provides. Again, no fault of Genesis itself.  It shouldn't take 3 appointments and 3 months  to have a recall service done, and the amount of stress they are causing by declining services, and rescheduling is absolutely appalling.   

I appreciate you, and i don't know if writing a complaint here will even matter. You guys tried, but unfortunately for me that dealership and the manager of their valet service is not ran by you.  If they had even a fraction of the customer service skills you guys do at your corporate office things would be entirely different. 

Your service is a 10/10

,,,Kevin Conley,07/13/2023,n/a,2,,5,3,2,1,2,"I've yet to receive a follow up on my concern which was about the amount of time it was taking to get an appointment with a Genesis dealership for service, particularly if I'd like to use the valet service (a service is heavily advertised and that contributed to my decision to choose a Genesis over similar luxury brands). the wait for a service appointment with valet and loaner was estimated to be three months later at one dealership. When I did have a service appointment, they weren't able to check in on a few of my concerns because of how busy they were, they told me I'd have to schedule a different appointment to check those issues and I had to choose which one concerned me the most. The issue I'm needing service on is the eLSD on my GV70 returning a warning on the dash. It was investigated and a part was ordered. The part was backordered with an estimate of 4 weeks. When that new part was installed, it was also faulty and now I have an estimated 2-3 weeks for the same part. While I understand supply issues based on similar stories from Genesis owners issues and delays with this part go back over 2 years, it seems as though Genesis corporate has not taken measures to address this issue appropriately. It is bad enough there is an issue like this on a car with under 4000 miles and purchased 6 months ago but the issue in compounded greatly when the dealership experience and expectations of owning a luxury product are not being met. I love my car and think the car itself is an amazing product but the overall Genesis ownership experience is leaving a lot to be desired.

I chose to do that and I reloaded the Sandisk 64 GB USB and let it run in the car for two hours and when I returned it was done.  Please look through the notes and cases opened for this and potentially use it as a training exercise because this could have been easily remedied and not required me to waste my time or the people at the other end of the phone and chat to spend time that couid have been used much more productively. ,33326622,Low Score 2 & 3 Star Response,"",07/14/2023,07/14/2023,07/14/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,27742393,,Bruce,Bonin,,bandbdad@optonline.net,,,,,,,2022,Genesis,G70,KMTG34TA3NU086536,173.2.93.165,77ec,,173.2.93.165,'Edge 114.0.1823.79','Windows 10',21690198,CA,2023/07/07 12:54:13,2023/07/12 07:12:00,Product Information,Mapcare,GCCC Care,GCCC Care,27742393,22910136,,5108,JASPREET.KAUR31,Eastern Region,Genesis Eastern District 4,NJ709,Y,"MAP UPDATE INQUIRY- After the map update , I am not able to use navigation update.

I bought a CPO GV80 with 5K miles on it from a dealership in Southern CA, I came back to the Bay Area  after adding on 3K.  My idea was to get the courtesy oil change at the San Bruno service center. The following listed all of the issues encounterd:-
1. Called svc center, left messages and NO ONE ever called back
2. Called parts, the voice mail was FULL; I couldn't leave any message
3. Called front desk to hand deliver the call back message; NO ONE called!!
4. Called Genesis connect to inquire for oil change, the gentleman there said my car wasn't eligable for the courtesy oil change!!!  What is the world was going on!! I then called again, a lady there was nice enough to do some research and told me that the vehicle I have indeed entitle for the service.  Excellent!! However, I had to to submit a CVP request.  OK.  I followed her instructions and have akl the required documents submitted.  It has been a week already, yet, I still haven't heard from anyone!!!!

,,,Robert Boyer,07/19/2023,n/a,3,,3,3,2,3,8,"I've had to call Genesis Customer Care several times since I bought my 2022 GV70. Almost every call centers around the Informat screen in the car. It has gone haywire on me quite a few times and a number of those times I have called you folks for help. At one point in those calls, I believe a software update was mentioned by one of your people but I didn't have the time to listen (my fault) and your agent helped me ""fix"" the problem. So now I've had this Informat screen numerous times scramble itself for no reason, but I've been able to get it back where it was initially set it. The latest event where it came off of it's track, I decided to call Customer Care. The woman I spoke with helped me with my immediate issue, but when I asked her about a software update since it derails itself quite often, I guess I thought from my prior conversations, this could be handled right then and now. I live just over 50 miles from the Genesis dealer, so driving to his shop is time consuming and costly (fuel and turnpike tolls). I guess I felt like I was blown off with our conversation and I have to say every other time I spoke with your agents, they've always treated me with the utmost respect. Maybe I'm reading her wrong, but it just wasn't like all of my other ""I really want to help you"" conversations with your group.

,,,Jason Myers,07/20/2023,n/a,5,,5,5,5,3,5,"My experience with Nicholas was really good, so I want to clarify that I rated the time it took to handle my questions as ""average"" only because it took about an hour on the phone with him to reset my car's connection to Connected Services and reset everything so that the app on my phone worked.  We had to go through various things on the menu, and the amount of time shouldn't be a negative reflection on Nicholas.  He was very helpful, and I had a lot of questions.
Regarding how likely I would be to recommend the Genesis brand, I have to tell you that I'm very much on the fence about this.   The car is great, and I've told people so, but I've also told them that my experiences getting the car serviced twice (once for warranty replacement of the differential and once for a regular ""first service"" of tire rotation and oil change) were both sub-par.   This refers specifically to Delray Genesis in Delray Beach, FL. 
I have been extremely dis-satisfied with Delray's level of professionalism, speed of work (4 days for a tire rotation and oil change), lack of willingness to offer next-level customer service (such as software update that I instead had to do myself), inputting incorrect mileage figure into service record (and failure to correct it when I notified them), failure to reset car's service interval reminder, and failure to wash the car before returning it to me.  Also, they don't answer the phone- I had to drive over there to find out why they still hadn't finished my ""first service"" after 4 days.  I realize that everyone is short of skilled help, but all I can tell you is that my other car is a Lexus, and the service experience there is far, far superior.   Genesis will not succeed as a brand until the dealership and service experience are on a par with other luxury brands.
My experience buying the car at Genesis Cherry Hill in Marlton, NJ was very positive, but unfortunately that's too far from where I live to get it serviced there.

,,,Mark Kahan,07/23/2023,n/a,2,,4,3,2,2,1,"You asked, so here you go. It was QUITE a TERRIBLE experience (NOT due to Jessica). I called in a few weeks before my appointment to be sure the dealership had a tire I needed to replace (It had a bubbled sidewall after only 15KMi). I was told they did, that they had two actually, and that they could do my servicing & a grease & oil and fix a rocker panel and it could all be done in the AM. I was also told (both by a ""Craig""), that I had the extended warrantee so the costs for the tire would be under $50.  The dealer did NOT have the tire, the warrantee expired a month earlier (but the bubble was clearly there earlier). I've asked the Dealership to honor the warrantee (still TBD). I also provided  the phone number & name of the owner of J&K Tire in Hudson, MA (where they said they could certainly match their lower price - worst case (again,  still TBD). I didn't get my car back until 8.5 Hrs after I brought it in which significantly impacted two proposals I was working on. I was VERY disappointed in the dealership, and I'm waiting to see if they do the right thing on this. PS.. Craig had  quit the dealership the week before my appointment; but, regardless, it was clear why I was coming in to have work done & the tire changed, but no one thought ahead and it cost me a day I didn't have to waste.  I'm the Chief Engineer of a portion of a large $6B-US 20K-person company and deal with many companies/vendors. I  am very disappointed with Genesis. I still haven't decided if I'm going to relate this truthful experience to the world at large on Social Media. The ball is currently in the Framingham new dealership's hands (James Thorp & Noah Whipple). If you need further information feel free to ask (my Cell is 626/833-2715).

None the less she was very understanding and did her best to help me which is why I gave an excellent rating.  My call was to Roadside Assistance, but after several sessions of going through the phone tree for RA, and continually being returned to the start of selection process, I gave up and called Connected Services.  I thought I might have a better chance of getting through the phone tree to a real person which turned out to be Kelly.  I must say I am very unhappy I could not get through to a live person in RA.

I'd like to think that having a check engine light come on in the middle of a road trip would trump somebody getting a regular oil change or that somehow, someone could squeeze her in since this was kind of an emergency, but no. No one would help- in fact Brian at Allen Turner in Pensacola got irritated with her because she sounded desperate.

,,,James Finch,07/23/2023,n/a,1,,1,2,1,1,0,"This is the third time my brand new GV70 bought from Kearny Mesa Genesis and currently with about 500 total miles has been in the shop. The second time it was in for over a week and returned to late causing me to reschedule  business appointments. This time it is projected to be out of use for five days. 

The prevalent pass-the-buck, responsibility-dodging attitude among middle management at this dealership has clearly been languishing for a very long time and has become internally acceptable but dire for investors.

My powertrain warning light came on again and Chadd Clowes, Sales Manager, told me not to drive it and not to bring it to Genesis Kearny Mesa where I bought it, but to take my car thirty miles away to the Genesis Escondido Service Department. 

Joe Spurrier, General Manager, told me he would not give me a loaner and would not rent me a car. Finally he agreed to buy me a Lyft ride home … then I could walk. 

This is a brand new car that I bought in early June at this dealership. There is a core of illness of arrogance and irresponsibility among middle management at this Kearny Mesa Dealership. There is full focus on sales for instant gratification but perhaps ultimate business failure. There appears to be virtually no emphasis on responsible follow through which of course would help secure long term success.

It is time for the SunRoad owners and Genesis Headquarters to get onsite and do some heavy duty weeding.

A footnote: perhaps GM Joe rethought his knee jerk dodge as smiley faces eventually came out of the woodwork to help and provide a loaner. But at that juncture I had endured a couple hours of unnecessary denial and abuse only to achieve what I had been promised by the same folks when I bought the car.",33387354,"","",07/23/2023,07/23/2023,07/23/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,27254322,,James,Finch,,finch92101@gmail.com,,,,,,,2023,Genesis,GV70,KMUMADTB9PU121340,136.26.46.224,d31a,,136.26.46.224,'Mobile Safari 16.5.2','iOS 16.5.1',21761188,CA,2023/07/21 14:11:14,2023/07/21 14:22:00,Warranty Issues,Coverage,GCCC Care,GCCC Care,27254322,28953537,,,MICHAEL.GRZYB,,,,Y, GOODWILL REIMBURSEMENT REQUEST FOR  RENTAL,INFORMED OWNER ON REINBURSMENTS,MICHAEL,

,,,John Miller,07/29/2023,n/a,4,,5,4,3,5,9,"I did not talk to anybody named Dustin.  I did talk to two females who were unfailingly polite, courteous and as helpful as possible.  MY concern was with the navigation system.  I was promised that the situation would be looked into.  It was not resolved.  Specifically, there is no option to avoid major highways.  That is a problem in Atlanta where I live and the interstate is always under construction and I frequently want to stay on surface streets.  I also find the fact that you can't view a turn by turn menu until you start driving not only dumb, but dangerous.  The fact that you can't go through each proposed route step by step in advance makes it very difficult to decide which route to choose.   I have put a Garmin GPS in my car and will use that until these issues are resolved.  I have another issue which I did not mention and that is the requirement to confirm every time you start the car.  I have only owned my G80 less than two months and this has already frozen on me once.  The only way I could get out of this was to reset everything which meant I had to go through the entire setup process a second time.  I find this requirement incredibly annoying and inconvenient.  Having said all that, I will say that I like everything else about the car. I like the way it drives.  I like all the safety features, especially the blind spot camera which is the main reason I bought the car.
Sincerely,
John Miller

,,,Jefferey Vines,07/27/2023,n/a,5,,5,4,5,4,9,The issue related to blocking the Auto Dim port in the back of the rear view mirror.  Sergio noted that the port could be dirty and noted where it is located.  That is when I realized that I had placed my Fast Trac bridge toll device in the back of the rear view mirror over the Auto Dim port which engaged the Auto Dim feature making it very hard to see through the side view and rear view mirrors.  I immediately corrected the situation thanks to Sergio.  I will say that before talking to Sergio I tried to find information about Auto Dim in the manual and could not find any.  I suggest that the location of the Auto Dim port be provided so other owners could discover this issue.,33407304,"","",07/26/2023,07/27/2023,07/27/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,28323887,,Jefferey,Vines,,jeffreyvines@comcast.net,,,,,,,2023,Genesis,GV60,KMUKEDTB9PU013909,71.202.208.153,d4d7,,71.202.208.153,'Safari 15.6.1','Mac OS X 10.15.7',21769610,CA,2023/07/24 10:36:32,2023/07/24 10:50:54,Product,Model Information,GCCC Care,GCCC Care,28323887,29992422,,,SERGIO.JUAREZ02,,,,Y,2023 GV60 AUTO DIMMING,INFORMED OWNER THAT SENSOR MIGHT BE BLOCKED OR DIRTY,SERGIO,

The car is also almost due for the first oil change. I asked about using the valet service that I heard all about during the sale of the car. I was told the earliest they had that available was September 28. That was two months out. So, I explained that the turn signal wasn’t working and that I needed an appointment sooner and that I would bring the car in myself but that I had been told that they offered loaner cars while the cars were being fixed. They told me that the loaner cars were all taken and that they didn’t see any becoming available in the near future, but to go ahead and bring the car in for the oil change and the turn light. I think the free oil changes is a nice “perk” and frankly would have been impressed with just that, but why sell “extra” perks that really aren’t available? Also, I am a bit concerned that I’ve had the car 5 months and something is already not working. My previous car was an Acura and it had no problems, seriously none beyond normal wear and tear.

The NJ dealer did not help me; my dealer was dismissive the first time.

,,,Jennifer Clements,07/29/2023,n/a,5,,5,5,5,5,10,"This comment has nothing to do with the customer service representative I spoke with on the phone. She was professional, polite and very helpful. It is however a complaint regarding customer service at the only dealership near me. 

Richmond, VA is desperately in need of another warranty center. The service department at the Genesis dealership on Midlothian Turnpike, the only option available to us, is not a place I would recommend to anyone!!  The male service manager at the dealership is horrible. The female service manager is very nice, but I believe the man I am referring to is in charge. He is quite arrogant and rude. Certainly not what should be customer facing for a luxury brand. I have been in customer service for 38 years, so I understand that some customer’s expectations are not reasonable, or achievable. My request was not unreasonable, and it aligns with the treatment I am accustomed to at Audi, Infiniti, Acura and EVEN GMC. 

I called for a REPEAT visit for a known sunscreen issue with Genesis GV80’s. The issue had ALREADY been deemed a warranty issue the first time my vehicle was in for repairs. The first time I used it, weeks later, it did the very same thing. Since this appointment request was for a repeat warranty issue, and the warranty center is almost an hour away, I requested a loaner. Please note: Every brand dealership mentioned above has provided us with a loaner in situations like this— without an issue. Audi even provided a loaner when I had routine maintenance done, without me even having to ask. The service manager denied my request for a loaner, “unless it was deemed a warranty issue”. I explained the difficulties of not having a vehicle to drive (for the 2nd time), driving over 45 minutes each way, the difficulty of coordinating someone to drive that distance to pick me up and drop me off TWICE……or I am forced to miss work and wait around until the dealership looked at the vehicle and deemed it a warranty issue.  Here’s the REAL PROBLEM. This dealership doesn’t have loaners unless you schedule an appointment 6 weeks out. So, if I drop off my vehicle and they decide it’s a warranty issue they won’t have a loaner available, because it wasn’t scheduled ahead of time. I found that out the first time at this dealership. What would happen then? I would be stuck there.

I also explained that I couldn’t miss work sitting, waiting for a decision. I tried to remind him that it was deemed a warranty issue the first time—and a known issue. He insisted something must be stuck in the sunroof. I told him if something was stuck, then it should have been found the first time the vehicle was in for repairs.  He repeated that a loaner wouldn’t be provided until the vehicle was looked at. I asked if I could have a loaner and they just charge me for it in the event they deem it not a warranty issue. He very rudely said “NO!”. At that point I just hung up the phone as there’s no reasoning with that level of arrogance, and lack of customer service. 

Interestingly enough, 2 weeks later a man claiming to be the dealership’s part-time finance manager pulled into my driveway. He said he saw my Genesis while driving through our neighborhood and stopped to ask if I liked it. I told him I did, but explained the problem and my recent frustrating experience with the dealership. He was very apologetic upon hearing how I was treated, but honestly didn’t seem surprised. 

With that dealership as my only option for an ongoing, unrepaired warranty issue, my husband and I are considering switching back to an Audi. If other customers experience the same attitude when seeking service, they WILL choose other brands when it’s time to replace their vehicles. There should be another option for service/warranty work closer than Alexandria.

I have been informed all of the local (within 40 miles) Genesis Dealers have closed and the closest to me (PA 17022) is in Bellaire Maryland. There is also a recall on the car. I have stayed under my lease mileage and would like to buy the car when the lease is up in March 1024, but I believe your company has broken the lease by not being able to provide the promised concierge service.  I am at a loss and not sure what to do.

Sergio was great but unable to solve any of my problems other than provide me the Belaire Maryland Genesis location.  He did his job to the best of his ability, so I would rate him highly, but not my situation. Please Advise.

I've been without the service for months because I was told by Service at two different dealers that I would have to leave my car for a day in order to reset the sw/head unit.  It seems that this problem could have been fixed if Genesis informed their dealers of the relatively simple fix which Andrew explained to me, which I can do myself (at least my new dealer said I need to call Genesis help if Connect services stopped again).  Secondly, Andrew shared with me that in order to keep the head unit from going into a deep sleep (apparently the issue), customers are required to send command every few days.

At this point, I will have to admit that I am frustrated with the Genesis Customer experience but not necessarily the Genesis Customer Care Experience.  To wit:  I have owned the car for 69 days and out of those days, the car has been disabled for 33 of them - in essence, for about half of the time I've owned the car, it has been non-functional!!

As I write this, my car has been in the shop for the past nine days due to a dead battery and no one can estimate when it will be returned to me.  I am also missing a laser cut key and no one has yet responded to me on that matter either!!  I have reached out to everyone at Genesis which I can think of and, although I do receive an ""automated reply"" stating that someone will touch base with me, no one does.  Attempts to call the dealership is also fruitless and the only time I can leave a message is when they tire of me calling all of the time.  I have owned other luxury brands (namely:  MB, BMW, Audi, and Jaguar) and I must say that I've always been treated better than what I am getting from Genesis.

1) the new car buying and delivery experience is no way near to what Genesis made people believed. Not enough inventory, neither custom order. 
2) pick up and drop off maintenance service is a joke. Not only  Genesis Kirkland in Seattle wouldn’t do that. They won’t guarantee me a courtesy car if I drop off my car at the dealership. 
3) all the dealerships nearby have no service schedule available for next 2 months. What a joke. 
4) roadside emergency service, no help at all until about an hour after. By then we have find help ourselves and made it to our hotel.

My situation started in May at Glenbrook of Ft. Wayne. Got the safety recall and about the same time my check engine light came on. Got my appointment with them, they did the safety recall and diagnosed the issue. PO 203 present for cylinder 2 misfire. Upon inspection found fuel leaking from cylinder 2 injector, parts ordered for replacement. Appointment set there, called to make sure parts were in, was told yes. Went to set appointment, was given a loaner, returned 3-4 hours later to find out not all parts were in, was called once parts were in, appointment set. Five days prior to my appointment, was called and told they no longer are a Genesis dealer and can not fix the problem, was told Genesis customer care would be in contact with me. Waited 2 weeks, no call. I made a call to the care line and was set up with Taylor of Perrysburg. I called and explained my issue, they got me in the next day. Upon arrival I was told that there wasn't a service tech available and that whoever I spoke with shoud not of set my appointment. They did set another appointment for next week. But so far I've had to drive 108 miles round trip to Ft. Wayne and 210 miles to Perrysburg with no results. Plus, it's going to take at least 2 trips to resolve my issue. Just having my 2022 G80 a year, is this the level of customer service I can expect ?

The problem was with the connected services.  I had trouble getting it to work after it expired. I signed up and got 3 months free but nobody could make it work. Tanya was calling to make an appointment to have the head checked.  However by then it had come alive and was working but quit again because my 3 months free had ended. Tanya told me she would give me 1 year of connected services free to make up for this. It never happened.  I tried to call Tanya at her number (833 462 8722 X 65170) she was always unavailable leave a message. I have never been able to reach her.  Called help line and Christyanna said she would forward to Tanya and opened a new case number 21823513.  I still have not heard from anybody and checking my online Genesis system does not show the Connected Services for 1 year having been added.  
I am most disappointed in you're help line.  When I call with the extension to Tanya all you get is leave a message and then it hangs up with no recourse to talk to a human.

My complaint is that it took a week or more between when they would contact me to do something, I would do it and it didn't work and tell them, then it would take another week for them to call me to have me do something else that didn’t work and it just repeated. I think it was a full 5-6 weeks to get it resolved. It's the system or the engineers that I have an issue with. They also told me they wouldn't approve any repairs at the dealership until this process completed. Terrible customer experience.

I think it is a company culture to ask the customer to jump through time consuming hoops to reset things. I want my remote start from my iPad to stay working, not for just a month or two. There is red writing saying I need to schedule a service. This appeared 2 days after I received a monthly report saying everything with the car was fine. The car is only 4 months old. Phone calls to the dealership in Vancouver haven’t been helpful. They told me to check the oil, if it was fine, not to worry. We even stopped in person and were given a phone number that was a tech person that works directly with the service department not customers.
I finally called back to schedule a valet service appointment. The problem with that is there was no opening for approximately 7 weeks. Hopefully this car does not have any other issues.

Both dealers in our city are Hyundai dealers first and Genesis dealers second. One is over 30 miles from home and the closer one is terrible. They have long wait times even for a simple oil change and routine maintenance service. Appointments range from two weeks to over a month. If the Genesis brand wants to be as good as Lexus or other premium vehicles...they need much better service and dealers. I really like my G90 but I am very disappointed by the local service that is available. At a minimum, you should have a separate service writer, mechanics and waiting area that is reflective of the brand. If the combined dealerships can't provide superior service over their non-premium brands then you should quit using them. They are hurting your reputation and brand.

A few months ago when I went there for service, Capitol Hyundai was an authorized Genesis dealer, and it was only after I drove two hours from my home to Greensboro that I learned they had lost their Genesis affiliation.

I tried to get an appointment and loaner car last week via genesis connect. I never received an email or text with an appointment date. So I stopped by my dealership where I purchased my vehicle. To my surprise they apparently take appointments a month in advance and do not offer loaner cars. This was not how my first service appointment was imagined by me.

Business is business, which is why I will not buy from STERLING dealerships, and I simply won't drive an hour to the next GENESIS dealer. I absolutely love my vehicle, but since day 1 of my experience, the service is subpar. Sales & service MUST COORDINATE if your brand is to gain even more traction and to gain more market share. So sorry it has to be this way- I don't normally bitch about these things, but this scenario is simply unacceptable.  Thanks for listening.

But…….

My initial call to the local Genesis dealer was not as good. I had an issue with a sunroof seal (that I actually ended up fixing on my own) and called the dealer for an appointed which they could not provide for 3 weeks!   Was given the managers name and connected with his voicemail and NEVER received a call back regarding my sunroof concern. This was Genesis of East Louisville (Oxmoor Hyundai) - Cory is the name I was given. Very disappointed and it makes me question taking my new GV80 there for my first service which is coming up soon.

TX713,45684,Genesis Of Spring,Byron Weaver,09/01/2023,n/a,2,1,1,1,1,1,7,"Basically it was below average. 
First, the texting service from Clay Nedal was Non-existent.  After 3 attempts of my sending him text, of His Initiating, he never replied to any of them. 
My concern was that when I brought my car in at the designated appointment time, which was set almost 3 weeks in advance, that the correct parts would be in stock.
When I made the appointment with Clay I Specifically asked when I brought my 2024 GV80 in would he have the parts on hand available for install. He told me that they would. 
From that time up the date and time of my appointment I tried calling and texting him 6 times asking him to confirm that the parts would be available when I arrived. I never heard back from him. My Appointment was set for 10am Wednesday,  August 30th. I live 50 miles from the dealership. So, at 7:30 am I called the parts department and spoke with the parts saleman who confirmed that only half of the needed parts were available. He even checked with Clay to see if he may have pull them for my installation,  but he had not. So I immediately called Clay, and was lucky enough to catch him and asked him to cancel the appointment for lack of stock parts.
He did cancel my appointment but also told me that the next available time would be 2 weeks out. I was 1. Very Disappointed with Clay's lack of concern with what I consider ""His attention or shall I say Lack Of Attention to my initial request as well as having the audacity to tell me I would have to wait 2 weeks for a slot from my initiating a new appointment request. 
The Install of Mud Guards only takes 1 hr maximum installation time.
The bottom line is I feel like I was treated like I bought a Cheap low end car, Not a Genesis Brand.
I am very happy with the car but the service I got was Hyundai Level, Not what I would expect From The Genesis Brand.
I rate it no more than 2 on a 1 to 10 scale.
P.S. Given my experience I decided to order the parts online from Genesis OEM. When I get them I will call Clay to set another appointment but I WILL NOT EXCEPT HAVING TO WAIT FOR 2 MORE WEEKS.

The customer service at the dealership experience is severely lacking professionalism. My Genesis customer care representative was helping me resolve some issues with my brand new GV80 having Bluetooth connectivity issues. But, she could not get ahold of multiple different dealerships to get a service appointment. The soonest that they could service my car was 6 weeks out. She was very nice...but the problem still has not been resolved. I was told she would contact me back after they had confirmation of a service appt. My car is brand new... I have yet to have it working 100% correctly since I purchased it 1 month ago.  Another issue is the dealership registered the wrong VIN to my connected services. They registered the wrong car altogether. So, My connected services did not work the first month. 

Then, the dealership took running boards off my vehicle and replaced it with a part that was scratched.

In particular, Teresita was rude and undertrained and spoke to me condescendingly. In the end, after I had done the research that Genesis Customer Care should have done, the $50 deductible was not charged to me because the CPO warranty explicitly states that there is no deductible for a covered 6/75k repair. 

NONE of the Genesis Customer Care reps were able to resolve my issue, mostly because of Teresita’s lack of knowledge and training. It was resolved by the dealer taking the time to follow up on MY research. I should not have had to spend the inordinate amount of time I did dealing with your incompetent customer service. I repeat that Michael was the exception, but his hands were tied by Teresita’s previous incompetence.

I continue to have utterly horrible experiences with your systems and procedures. Congratulations on adding another one to my list.

,,,Theresa Foster,09/10/2023,n/a,1,3,3,1,1,1,2,"Hello. So I have owned my New Genesis for one month. I traded in a 2021 genesis GV 80 for a 2024 GV 80. Everything is fine on this car except we cannot connect to Genesis Connected Services. We have tried everything. We have called you all and talked with engineers and sent in photos and still cannot connect. We believe it is software related, but no one can figure it out. Maybe the fact we had a 20 one before? Not sure, but we keep getting the same error code that we need to subscribe to the subscription. However, we are. So now we are at the point where Genesis of Elizabethtown is ordering a new head unit. Although, I don’t think that’s the issue. I don’t know what it is. The Facebook group I am a part of states and possibly is software. I have spent countless hours on the phone and left my car several times at the dealership to see if they can fix this issue.  I would think the engineers would be able to fix this, but they have not. If you all know of any other vehicles having this problem which, apparently according to my Facebook group is quite a bit of them. This is something that Genesis needs to look at and correct. You can call me anytime at 254-289-0538. My husband also owns a Genesis GV 70 and prior to that we owned the genesis G 80. So we are well familiar with the brand.

She asked what I would like her to do?
I want a case number and it documented that I’m calling to complain about this issue.
It felt like I was bothering her!
I’m the one that spent $50 grand on this car and I’m not happy ..
Other people said the dealer was able to fix these problems, maybe it’s the dealership I’m dealing with..
I know a lot of businesses are short staffed but this is unacceptable!",33754523,Low Score 2 & 3 Star Response,"",09/14/2023,09/18/2023,09/18/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,26107535,,Debra,Duhr,,debbieduhr@aol.com,,,,,,,2023,Genesis,G70,KMTG34TA6PU104384,174.211.174.71,a3d7,,174.211.174.71,'Mobile Safari 16.6','iOS 16.6.1',22011320,CA,2023/09/12 08:06:02,2023/09/12 08:17:12,Product,Design Feature,GCCC Care,GCCC Care,26107535,27816397,,,VANESSA.CASTELLANOS,,,,Y,"[Year/Model] VEHICLE COMPLAINT NEGATIVE FEEDBACK,-Had the car at the retailer for 6 days and the rattling in the sunroof is worse than before and the door molding is not right.",Will notate the complaint,VANESSA,

Katherine did the best she could given the situation, my vehicle has stalled twice in intersections with under 20,000 miles. Katherine gave me guidance on how to resolve my brand new vehicle engine misfiring and fast track my service request, it’s the follow up from her call that is extremely frustrating. She directed me to call roadside assistance to schedule a tow which was unsuccessful, I pressed 3 to be connected to the tow department which brought me back to the main menu and I went through the loop three times before I hung up. I have left a voicemail to the dealership to request a service tow and have yet to hear back. The dealership is able to secure a loaner vehicle for repairs 9/21. Now I am expected to drive a vehicle that is questionable in reliability from tucson to Gilbert for service. I rely on my vehicle for work which is why I decided to go genesis was for the reliability I have researched. This is not the service I was expecting from Genesis and am looking to trade in my vehicle due to the money spent and the poor service that I have received so far.

,,,Frederick Mackler,09/21/2023,n/a,5,5,5,5,5,5,10,"By the time I finally reached Austen I had been in contact with 3 different local Genesis dealerships, (2 in South Carolina & 1 in North Carolina), and at least 8 (EIGHT!) different people between them... (e.g. service techs, service writers, & service managers). NONE of them were helpful... And more importantly, none of them seemed interested in helping me!

I WAS NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER! 

Austen took the time to troubleshoot the car's issue(s) withme on the phone, research the potential causes off line, and call me back with several options I could choose from to resolve them.

He then set up an appointment for me and arranged for a loaner vehicle. (BY THE WAY, the SAME people I spoke with previously told me a loaner was NOT availabe and could not be authorized!)

In rating the dealerships I was in contact with based on the above, their scores hover in the ""POOR"" to ""BELOW AVERAGE"" range... Austen's scores... EXCELLENT across the board! 

Genesis is fortunate to have Austen as a representative for your brand, your ""on site"" agents could learn much from him.

Thanks,

MD707,45819,Genesis Of Owings Mills,Deborah Handelman,09/27/2023,n/a,5,5,5,5,3,5,7,"I love my car, but I have been extremely frustrated in trying to find a dealer in my area who will service my Genesis. It was very unclear as to when the first service for my GV70 2023 Genesis should be scheduled. The message on my car came up at 4,000 miles stating it needed a service. I called three different Hyundai dealers in my area and was appalled at what I found. The Lens Stoler dealership in Owings Mills, Maryland is the closest to me. I called there five times to the service department and no one ever answered the phone and there was no way to leave a message. I called the car sales department there because I knew somebody would answer the phone. Two different people told me they would give my message ( that I wanted to make a service appointment) to the service department and someone would call me. No one ever called me. 
Then I called the Hyundai dealership in Towson, Maryland and was told they do not service Genesis vehicles. I called the Hyundai dealer in Clarksville, Maryland (which is 40 minutes away from me) and was told there was at least a 3-week wait for service. When I inquired about a loaner car, which is supposed to be part of my ""perks"" for 3 years through Genesis Customer Care, I was told there are no loaner cars and that people are on the waiting list for months to get a loaner when they have a service. The woman I spoke to would not even put my name on the list for a loaner. 
 When I looked online to see what is the recommended mileage for the first service, I saw that 8,000 miles was the recommendation. 
At this point, I was extremely frustrated, so I called the Genesis Customer Care number. Andrew was the representative who answered the phone.  He told me that the first covered service, through my plan, would not begin until 8,000 miles. So now you can see, not only could I not get an appointment to have my car serviced, I came to find out that my car was not really covered for a service until 8,000 miles. I have close to 5,000 miles on my car. 
Andrew was very patient and listened as I told him what I am writing here. He also explained to me about the coverage for the 3-year program. I did not see that written anywhere and I think that needs to be made clearer to customers. He could not explain to me why the Clarksville dealership didn't have loaner cars. The 3-year Genesis customer care program comes with the promise that somebody will come pick my car up when it is ready for the service, drop off a loaner car and then bring my car back. I can't even imagine how that is ever going to happen. I know, through reputation, that Genesis is a great car, but what I have seen of the service available for this car is beyond horrible. I'm hoping somebody can reach out to me and tell me what in the world is going on; are car dealers required to have a loaner car service for Genesis customer care patrons? Why don't all Hyundai dealerships service Genesis cars? I'm nervous about when my car is due for the first service and where I will end up taking it.
 I have previously owned Acuras for 20 years and I never had a service issue like this. I would call a week or 10 days before I wanted a service, I would drop my car off and I was always given a loaner car. Service is the bread and butter of every dealership and I always bring my car into the dealer for service. I'm loyal to a dealer and I take great care and pride in my car.  I don't understand why I am getting such a run around and it's leaving a very bad taste in my mouth thinking about what dealer I will choose to use when the car is ready for service. I would like somebody to reach out to me and assure me that the service promised to me when I bought my car will be fulfilled.",33818073,"","",09/23/2023,09/27/2023,09/27/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,28382638,,Deborah,Handelman,,bookqueen123@gmail.com,,,,,,,2023,Genesis,GV70,KMUMADTBXPU125204,69.140.16.89,0d17,,69.140.16.89,'Chrome Mobile 117.0.0.0','Android 10',22058529,CA,2023/09/21 10:53:04,2023/09/21 11:19:26,Service - Retailer,Treatment,GCCC Care,GCCC Care,28382638,30051543,,4752,ANDREW.TEMPLETON,MID-ATLANTIC,Genesis Mid Atlantic District,MD707,Y,GENESIS RETAILER SERVICE COMPLAINT; 2023 GV70; CUST has tried to reach out to MD707 multiple times to schedule an APPT but nobody will  call her back,ADV that normal intervals are every 8000 miles or 12 months,ANDREW,

When I told him I was not interested in buying that car because it was not the color combination. I wanted his attitude changed quickly then we went and said he talked to somebody and came out and said oh nobody has that then when I told him someone did, and he just said well when it comes in, give us a call and we can try and get it from them. And then he told me just to let you know there’s a market adjustment on the vehicle of $3000 and I asked why he said oh because the car is worth more now than it did before it’s a 2024 how is that even possible.

This was my very first time using the customer care service, and I had a representative from Genesis with me to help show me how to use my new car, which I purchased. Some of the features weren’t working so we opted to call customer care together from the car, but part of the steps to see if it could be resolved involved turning the car completely off and exiting it. She told us it was policy that she could not call the representative on his cell phone or me on mine, so we had to write down the steps and handle it on our own.  However, those steps didn’t do the trick and now it Hass to be sent to the service center for repair. I am still waiting to hear from someone at Genesis to schedule that as I will need a loaner and it seems there are not many available. I am absolutely loving my car, but it’s disappointing that some of the features don’t work with regards to the voice commands, and that nobody has gotten in touch with me  From the service center to resolve it and also that the customer care phone number would tell us to jot down instructions and that we have to hang up and they can’t help us from there. Certainly not the luxury and high-end customer experience I was sold on upon purchasing the car.

Servicing on your vehicles is a nightmare here in the Tampa Bay and New Port Richey stores. When I spoke with one of your respresensative on one of my conversations, I tried to schedule maintenance for my vehicle. She was rude and when I asked her why they would no longer pick my car up up for service from my job, she stated we don't have the personnel you will have to come to New Port Richey. I said to her well that was one of the reasons I purchased this vehicle in cash mind you and she said ""Oh well, that's life"". I relayed my conversation to New Port Richey with the person's name and not even a phone call from them from that conversation. That tells me a lot about how they feel about me as a customer.

I can only put a 6 for recommending Genesis brand.  Why? 1. My ""new"" 2911 miles, dealer owned ""used"" vehicle doesn't qualify for 3 year valet service for what reason? It's not like I bought it used from a non-dealer owner.  There should be exceptions made in this type of case.   2. Genesis dealers are awful.  Long wait times for appointments for service. Rip-off dealers adding $3000 packages and additional premium surcharges on top of an already premium priced vehicle. I won't deal with Genesis of West Houston again.  I bought my ""nearly new"" GV80 from a Genesis of Corona by doing  a nationwide search for color/package combo i wanted. Then i shipped it to me.

She called and  introduced me to Kevin at Genesis of Wexford (the only Genesis dealer in that area).  He  told me they weren't taking any appointments until 11/17 and hung up!  I was left to handle the situation all by myself.  I ended up driving the 3 miles to Wexford, fortunately spoke with Cory and Matt at the service center, and they quickly figured out that the gas cap was loose and the light went off, so I thought the issue was fixed.  The next day the light came back on, made sure the gas cap was screwed securely and the light is still on.  I didn't bother notifying Genesis Connected Services, since it did me no good the day before.  We are out of town, but once I get back in town, I have to go back to the service center to see if they can figure out what's going on.  
In addition, after I got the PA inspection done last week, the mechanic told me the hood of the car is off-kilter.  I left two messages for Genesis of Wexford to return my call which they never did.  On the third try, I finally spoke to a person who wouldn't make an appointment, but at least told me to stop by so they can see what is going on.

I have called twice and spoken with someone who says they are not assigned to my case and that the person who is will call me back. This has not happened either time.

I bought the car used (1,500 miles on it) from a Dealer in CA and it is serviced in Jacksonville, FL (had it shipped here after purchase).  Apparently the head unit (display screen) was not properly activated or more appropriated the software was not upgraded when it was installed.  Also, the right front wheel bearing went bad and it took me taking it to another repair shop and having them verify it was bad before I could convenience my local Dealer of the problem.  It took abt a month to get the part and today I noticed my undercarriage was dragging the ground on the right side, the side where the wheel assembly was replaced.  Half of it was missing.  Either the tech just ripped it away or failed to put the mounting screws back it and now it's in pieces.  Now I am worried about taking back to Dealer for fear of retribution.  It needs to be replaced and guess I will need to find a new Dealer for maintenance.

I recently had the 2023 G80 into Lakeland Genesis to replace the strip of glass between the windshield and the sun roof which experienced a stress fracture from door to door.  The work was done perfectly and on time and the service representative, Anthony, was courteous and professional.  I did ask for an oil/filter tire rotation per the additionally paid for maintenance plan.  Anthony stated that I would have to wait until 7500-8000 miles.  If I waited for 8000 miles and only changed every 8000 miles I would not get all the oil changes included in the maintenance plan before the plan expired.  I have always had the oil changed, particularly the first one  performed around 3000-4000 miles, including the 2 previous Genesis vehicles purchased new from Lakeland Hyundai/Genesis.

KY705,45797,Genesis Of Lexington,James Raim,10/15/2023,n/a,4,5,5,5,4,5,7,"The call center and rep experience was great. The problem I have is Lexington Genesis has a long wait (at times 2 months) before you can bring your car in for service.   This particular time I was not in any rush so my appointment in two weeks was fine. However, if I have an urgent repair I should not have to wait 2 months. I traded an Infiniti in for my GV70 and I could always get an appointment within 1 to 2 days. As a matter of fact when I spoke with my neighbor who has a Toyota, he gets appointments within a day or two. 

If you’re going to sell luxury cars that compete with Lexus, Mercedes, Infiniti etc. you need to inform your dealers they need to provide service like their luxury competitors. 

I like my GV70, however I would not purchase another one unless the service appointment time’s improve.  To be clear this is no reflection on the service writers or service manager. They have been very accommodating every time I have brought my car in for service. 

Please have Claudia Marquez (not sure of the spelling) read this comment and perhaps she can call Lexington Genesis and inform them of the standards Genesis aspire to.

,,,Thomas Minardo,10/18/2023,n/a,3,3,4,2,2,4,8,"Katrina was very professional and courteous on the phone.  She was not familiar with my issue, but suggested that I update my Navigation software in November when an update is expected.  I have owned my Genesis GV70 for more than 18 months and I just updated the Nav software.  If I do it again, I will be charged for the update.  Katrina understood my concerns and promised to email a Case Number of some kind so that I can us it to acquire the update in November at no additional charge.  BUT SHE NEVER SENT THE EMAIL!  For reference, I can tell you that the mapping was more user-friendly BEFORE the update.  They new update, while it gives me access to roads that have been constructed since my car was new, the roads are not identified in the new version.  So basically, I have a map without labels on it.  It’s basically worthless.  I’ve been using the maps from Android Auto which are far superior.  I new “look” of the updated maps needs to include feedback from customers like me.  1.  In addition to the aforementioned issue with the new map not having street names, 2.  When navigating, the street one is traveling on is displayed along with the next turn and the next street name. (Not on the map, but in the directions “box”.). But the font chosen for the street names is so small as to almost render it useless.  If a software engineer wants to contact me, please feel free to do so and I can explain in greater detail why the update was, in my opinion, a dismal failure.

But my experience with Genesis the manufacturer, the dealerships, and the finance department were all very bad experiences. Genesis of West Chester had completely terrible repair / maintenance services, and also completely screwed up my title when I paid my car off. It took them almost 2 months to provide me with clear title, causing me to not be able to cash checks that paid me for the car, and I had to let someone drive around with the car and the insurance in my name for 2 months to not lose the sale. Literally nobody at Genesis or Hyundai cared at all - I received absolutely no help from you all at all.

The website indicates customer service is available by phone Sundays, but the recorded phone message says they are closed Sundays. When I spoke with someone about the Navigation update she informed me that the most current update wasn’t yet available and the I should try again in a couple of days. Unfortunately, the Genesis is so high tech that it is too complicated for average people to figure out. We love the car, but we may need to trade it in for another brand without the high tech bugs and not owned by Auto Nation the stories of incompetence at the Savannah and Hilton Head Hyundai/Genesis dealers are legendary.

MD709,45833,Genesis Of Columbia,Lisa Snow,10/25/2023,n/a,3,3,5,3,1,3,4,"Vani, the service rep, was courteous and I believe we both thought when we hung up that my concerns would be resolved however it turns out they are not.  I called Genesis customer care because my connected services had recently stopped working and it was at particularly bad time when I was counting on it.   This is the second time this has happened since I bought my GV70  in September 2022.  I was also due for an oil change.  Vani helped me reboot the system and scheduled an oil change but as usual, the ""Genesis dealership"" service department which is really just a Hyundai shop does not have loaners or people to pick up up drop off for months.  At the end of my call with customer care, Vani also told me to ask the Genesis dealership to update the navigation system when I got there saying that is why having problems with connected service.  I thought Vani should have said that to the Genesis service department when scheduling.  I'm now at the service department and they say it will cost me $500 and 3-4 hours for them to update the navigation system. They said Hyundai has had recent problems with their customer service system which Vani didn't mention.  They say it is not covered (when I would have thought it was as I have a 2022 GV70) and said they will explain to me how to handle at home.  This information was not shared by customer care.  Also, Vani mentioned that there is a recall related to the fuel system but there is no process yet to actually get that done yet.  In general, I am disappointed that there really is no dedicated Genesis dealership and service center.  I feel when I bought this ""luxury SUV""  that Genesis over promised.   I bought this SUV for the advertised ease of courtesy service, security features and reliability.  I don't feel that has been the case -- Lisa Snow",34046046,Low Score 2 & 3 Star Response,"",10/25/2023,10/25/2023,10/25/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,23580215,,Lisa,Snow,,lisaksnow@yahoo.com,,,,,,,2022,Genesis,GV70,KMUMADTB9NU035135,35.196.165.230,9600,,35.196.165.230,'Chrome 118.0.0.0','Windows 10',22209578,CA,2023/10/23 07:29:01,2023/10/23 08:09:13,Remote Services,Functionality Concerns,GCCC Care,GCCC Care,23580215,25239091,,14000,VANI.CHOUHAN,MID-ATLANTIC,Genesis Mid Atlantic District,MD709,Y,REMOTE SERVICES TROUBLESHOOTING; 504.,scheduled service for 10/25/2023 at 2 PM at MD709.,VANI,

The Genesis dealer was able to correct the problem.  The update program said the update was completed so the Tech released the car.  Sometime between 5pm and 8:30 am the next day it finished loading and the street names were visible. Not a good experience for the customer or the Tech.  

Disappointed that the 2 Genesis dealers I have dealt with are not at the same level of customer service as Lexus and BMW.  Neither dealer had a separate showroom for Genesis and not near the  same customer service satisfaction.  Appears Genesis allowed any dealer to take on Genesis without adequate level of training/service for being a luxury dealership.  Especially little to no follow up verification by Genesis that they are capable of being considered a luxury dealership.

There are a number of minor issues with my car that I was not able to get resolved with the one dealership service appointment that I have had so far.

Earliest the new dealership could get my car in to try to resolve the issues and give me a loaner was a month away. I’ve had a new issue develop with the car since Geneva contacted me. I don’t drop it up until November 10th.

In short, not only did were they unable to locate the problem, the next day the car’s navigation system indicated that it required updating and essentially became inoperable. It is conceivable that the timing was coincidental and that the service center did not cause the problem, but I would have thought that updating the navigation system was a standard procedure for required service. Now I am unhappy because after spending hours trying to update (unsuccessfully) the navigation system on line, I called to request the update on a USB drive as advertised. I was sent a link to the third party provider, but when I tried to log-on it would not recognize my email and password, which I had just updated a couple of days before during my first unsuccessful and frustrating Genesis Custome Care experience.

This has happened at both the 16K and 24K included scheduled maintenance times.  It takes me between 2 and 4 hours to navigate the system, representatives not following through.  Being told an email is coming and it never did but let me be clear MARCO got it done and is awesome.

Genesis needs to get their act together.  If I was told there was no service valet or included service I would have bought the car, handled the maintenance just like all my other cars and would have been impressed with the vehicle.  Let me make it clear, other than the rear axle failure and leaking headlight, the GV70 is awesome.

CA711,45737,Genesis Of Escondido,Amy Bassett,11/03/2023,n/a,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,"This concierge service was one of the attractive aspects of purchasing my Genesis over other brands. I have found that scheduling my service appointments have been more in line with purchasing a low end vehicle. The blatantly incorrect information on the concierge service for booking an appointment and valet service created confusion, a week delay in service, impact on my work schedule, and having to have the car serviced on my birthday.  This has interrupted by work schedule, my personal schedule and the schedule of others. The actual service appointment made directly with the dealership was also not a pleasant experience.  The service person could not guarantee a loaner (although one was guaranteed when I made my appointment). No one called to confirm the appointment and I had to call. They didn't document was services I was needing and that I required a valet.  Since they couldn't confirm a loaner and couldn't confirm when my vehicle was going to be returned, I had to cancel my birthday plans since I did not know if I would have a vehicle or when I would.  I also found out the dealer does not repair any damage to the body and now I have to schedule another appointment at a collision center for body shop repair.  Luckily I was given a loaner, because I was informed that my car isn't going to be ready by COB today.... but I had needed my SUV to bring some larger items to an event tomorrow, and now I have no idea how I am going to transport my larger items tomorrow.  Overall this has been a disappointing experience that is affecting my desire to purchase another Genesis, since I have been shopping for another vehicle for our family,.",34104474,"","",11/02/2023,11/03/2023,11/03/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,23588225,,Amy,Bassett,,abassett@sbcglobal.net,,,,,,,2022,Genesis,GV70,KMUMADTB5NU026433,108.214.114.70,78d1,,108.214.114.70,'Edge 118.0.2088.76','Windows 10',22248907,CA,2023/10/30 12:40:17,2023/10/31 09:37:05,Service - Retailer,Service Valet - Wait Time,Siebel Administrator,GCCC Care,23588225,25254499,,14000,JESSYCA.CARRERA,Western Region,Genesis Western District 2,CA711,Y,GENESIS RETAILER (SERVICE) COMPLAINT; owner booked valet online and it didn't go through retailer advised they cannot use website for valet,doc complaint adv owner valet need to be booked through retailer owner aware of recalls,JESSYCA,

I had a problem getting into my Genesis Connections app as my wife' phone number was listed as primary contact/user vs my telephone number. Shelly quickly fixed the problem and also told me that my car had two software recalls that I didn't know about. My concern/frustration was that should have been completed in the PDI as I had just bought the car two days prior to speaking to Shelly and already, instead of driving it I had to go back into the dealer to have the software updated. Jennifer and Benson in Genesis Santa Monica service accommodated me with a loaner car and everything was handled within about two hours.  All is well and the Santa Monica dealership has lots of very helpful people including the GM, Tammy; Melvin, Andy, Alex Rutran and Ashley. Very impressed with Genesis so far.

I assume that may be because there have been software update but I don't know for sure.  

   I would suggest that you change the order so that ""general"" is at the top of the settings rather than the bottom where I never seem to think to continue to scroll down.  I ran Global Marketing at two financial services companies and one thing I learned is to never make affluent and intelligent, or (at least people who think they are) people feel stupid.

I live in Olympia, WA (state capital).  There are only 3 dealers left in Washington, all 2 hours away, and none at all in Oregon.  Marco couldn't coordinate my repairs with the dealer, only set up the tow, so I called Kirkland first.  Couldn't even look at the car until February.  Vancouver said they were 7 weeks out on tow-ins, but might be able to get to a diagnosis in a couple of weeks.  Only Everett said they should be able to get to it in ""a week or two"" (and it'll take the better part of a day to get a ride up there when it's fixed and drive it home).  Obtaining the maintenance and warranty service I was told I'd be entitled to has turned out to be a nightmare from the beginning.  I tell people I love the car, but without dealer support,  stay away.

We are NOW unable to use the valet service and I will driving an hour across DFW traffic for an oil change.  we are now giving serious consideration into selling our 5-month old GV70 for another Infiniti who had much better service and support after the sale.  I expect that decision to occur within the month.

The issue is, is there anyway to add a feature where you hold down the unlock button on the keyfob and all the windows go down. On hot summer days, that is a great feature to have so the car can air out. Even my 2010 lincoln and other old cars had that feature. 
I am not electrically inclined but it just seems like it could be an easy fix. My Genesis is a 2018 G90.
Just thought I would run it by you. Thanks.

I sent an email to Genesis for trouble with my car and all I got was the runaround.  My GV80 had a map update that I actually paid for because the OTA wouldn't work...Go figure.  Then the Navigation system started acting weird after install (No red light camera warnings).  I confirmed other cars still make the warnings that mine USED to until the update.  Took the car to the dealership who then told me that I had to contact Genesis.  Guess what!  Genesis told me to contact ""AutoEver"".  Really?!  This is why you will never be a premium brand.  My BMW dealership doesn't tell me to call someone else who then also tells me to call someone else.  To BMW, I'm the customer that bought a luxury premium brand and they take care of everything for me instead of telling me to do more work that by the way still isn't fixed.  It's pathetic.  I bought two of your cars two years ago and have already gotten rid of one of them.  Not because the product is bad.  It's the BRAND!!!  You can't get anything right as far as customer care/service/exclusivity/etc. is concerned.  I'm beyond fed up with this so-called premium brand.  Where I once told everyone about the tremendous vehicles you make, I now caution everyone who asks NOT to purchase unless they don't mind spending extra money to be treated like you bought a used 1985 Honda Civic from an independent dealer.

I have probably talked with a CS rep 5 times since last April, and have gotten a different response each time.

Your customer service was great, I have a problem that I need to get addressed During the call Christyanna contacted my local Hyundia dealership, made them aware of a recall, and advised. 
Unfortunately today I arrive at my Hyundai dealer and they have no recollection of the call, and no notes… 
I was also on that call so I know the extent of the conversation. 
Disappointed with my Hyundai dealership, and now I have to make a special journey to Genesis Greenville to have my car checked for the problem I have in addition to the recall.

,,,Bradley Ott,11/17/2023,n/a,3,3,5,3,3,5,6,"I purchased my car two years ago from a dealer near Albany, NY. Last month I was notified that the dealership I bought the car from no longer can sell or service Genesis products. I was given information about a new dealership in Albany which would be taking over the Genesis accounts, including mine. A few days ago I received a letter informing me of a serious issue requiring a recall of my vehicle. I called the new dealership in Albany and was informed that they were aware of the recall but couldn’t do anything until they received the proper parts. Since they were a new dealer they did not have the parts on site yet. I was put on a waiting list and was told it would take “about two weeks”  to hear from them. In the meantime I am left with a car I should not be driving due to safety issues and hoping that this issue will be resolved in a reasonable amount of time. I contacted Customer Care to alert them to this issue in the hope they would monitor the situation. I got the impression that there was little that they could do at this point. My concern is that I purchased a Genesis vehicle in good faith and now am left with a dealer I have never met and is not ready, at this point, to care for a serious safety issue. As I live about 90-100 miles from this new dealer I feel I have right to expect the valet service I was told would be available for the first 3 years and that my car will be properly taken care of. I’m willing to be patient but admit that this situation leaves me leery of dealing with Genesis in the future. This saddens me as I thoroughly enjoy my GV70.

My current email address is registered as a second driver on the Palisade.  Vanessa informed that she could not change my G80 account's email registration due to a system limitation that prevents the same email address from being connected to 2 different vehicles.  The only solution she could offer was for me to create a new ""disposable"" email address to connect the G80 to.  This is unacceptable and seems like poor software design.

,,,Dina Falcioni,11/18/2023,n/a,2,4,4,4,3,1,8,"While I love my car and truly couldn’t imagine driving anything else, the Genesis service dept. (specifically dealing with having the car picked up and dropped off) is an absolute nightmare. Genesis is not located near where i live so in purchasing the car the only reason i did was because they offered the car pickup for services. Otherwise it wouldn’t be worth it to have this car. Too much of an inconvenience to get it there for service. But I’ve come to learn while in theory the pickup service is convenient its actually a nightmare. It’s like pulling teeth to get an appointment to start with. Then once you get the appointment, the day the car is supposed to be picked up is always an adventure. I’ve had an issue every time. This most recent time being the worst. First they didn’t show. Then they didn’t have a car to bring to me. Then they had a car but it had no gas. Then they had a car but it was electric and had no charge. Then the guy bringing the car went to the wrong place (an hour and a half away from me). While the girl in service was pleasant and did her best (it wasn’t her fault) it was a nightmare. The questions on the survey don’t really cover the actual issues. Finally the new manager got involved but by that time the damage was done. I spent half of my work day dealing with the endless logistic issues. The manager did his best to make things right in the end. Even offering a detailing of the car that had to be brought had to me a day later because they were so late picking the car up. 
One would think if it takes months to actually get a pickup svc appointment that at the very least they’d have their ducks in a row once it came time for your appointment and would have both a driver and a car available.

Trying to understand why as one of the earliest adopters of the Genesis why I am  not eligible for the $2K incentive(only $1K) for buying a New Genesis just because I live in the wrong zipcode.  I received a form letter back saying the local dealership have control of what they offer.  I get that, but this was a corporate incentive. There was no help…it felt like the organization just had to check the box to say it cleared the issues. I am still disappointed. However, i am going to still purchase a new car (GV80)  from you guys even through I won’t expect any significant customer support from the corporate level of Genesis. Kinda weird that someone who  took a risk getting your vehicle as a early adopter, doesn’t get the same benefits as other adopters just because they live in a different zipcode. I suggest you review this procedure or make sure the differing offers  are not accessible by all.

I only completed the score is because they were required. A better option would have been N/A. I don’t believe in providing ratings where there was no action on the question asked. Please don’t beat up on Jessyca because of the way the company designed the customer experience in this cause…the engagement was not customer friendly.

,,,David Peterson,11/18/2023,n/a,1,1,5,1,1,1,5,"Michael was fine but there wasn't a proper answer for my question. My vehicle has presented an emergency low tire pressure warning but there was no way to confirm what the vehicle was reading. Also there is no way to clear or see the warning, a Orange Triangle with Exclamation Point and number next to it. How do see what the sign is? I haven't found a way to read it, and this occurred while driving, raising my level of anxiety. I checked the tire, and it is fine, so the system is falsely indicating and issue that is not present. The dealership has lost most of their service staff and it isn't easy to get an appointment. How do I clear this issue and actually see what it is?

,,,William Jenkins,11/21/2023,n/a,4,4,4,4,2,3,8,"Doubt this effort will have positive results.  Always have felt these surveys are seldom read and if read, no response is received.
Here goes:  I bought G80 2023 with 15k mileage.  Traded in 2018 G80 I bought Couresty of Tampa.  Never had nothing but positive reactions anytime I had maintenance/service with all interactions being complimentary with no financial outlay from me.
I purchased this 2023 G80 being assured by salesman y Sales manger of Jenkins Genesis Leesburg all services/warranty would be in effect to the 60k mileage point.
Today, after setting appointment for Parks Genesis Gainesville, I kept appointment.  Every step of the process was exemplary until I was informed there wasn’t a service agreement y close to $80 had to be paid.
I paid!!!  However, this incident soured my day y questioned the customer service policy Genesis promotes.
The amount isn’t the big thing:  it is the principle of my paying cash initially for this vehicle y being told by Jenkins Genesis service/warranty would be in effect until 60k mark.
I drove over 1 1/2 hours to Parks because I had good feelings to initial contact with dealership.  The same distance/time if I went to Jenkins Leesburg.  The reason I bought G80 from JenkinsLeesburg was Parks didn’t have one for test drive whereas Jenkins did.
Now I await for response.

While waiting for the locksmith I called the blue link service and got Alexis. I explained the situation and wanted to know if she could unlock the doors for me. I provided her with my information and then she informed me the software on my car was not up to date so she could not assist me. 

As turns out the other guy dispatching the locksmith dispatched one over an hour away from me. Why he chose one so far I do not understand. I ended up busting the back passenger window out so I could get to my dogs. 

I was not pleased with either persons lack of ability to assist me. I am also unclear how the car locked with my keys in it and why my car hasn’t asked me to update it. I have had the car since July 2022 and the car has only asked me to update once which I did. I am very upset with the whole situation.

YIKES, the navigation software is at least TEN YEARS out of date for my home neighborhood and is terrible in terms of actual voice recognition and finding even long standing community locations, e.g. a local COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUS!!!!.  Further it is simply thoughtless to demand resetting ""1 pedal"" driving every time one starts the car.  The vehicle should restart in the same operation ""style"" that was used when last shut down!!!!  OH, and who is the software manager who cannot expand the range of ANDROID PHONES that can work as a digital key???  DOUBLE YIKES!

The app said I didn't have a valid subscription, even though it also shows active subscriptions. After calling, the only contact I've received is emails asking me to complete surveys. The problem is still not resolved, yet you want me to provide feedback and ratings? If Genesis put the same level of effort into resolving issues in a more timely manner as it does into surveying, my feedback would be different. I'm really only sharing whether I think Mackenzie was polite (she was). Her ""ability to solve my concern"" is rated poor because she does not have the tools to resolve it. This survey is strange to me, because on one hand you want me to share how I feel about an unresolved problem, and on the other hand you want me to rate your employee's ability to resolve it. I kindly suggest you redesign the survey so that your employees aren't penalized for issues they're not able to resolve. Other feedback: I have no insight into this ticket after it's opened.

In the future, if I were to  consider purchasing /leasing leasing another Genesis when this lease ends I would have several concerns related, not only to the current experience that I’ve had, but in addition prior issues with the service, as well as multiple recalls that I’ve experienced with this vehicle, which I have never had in the past.
I would hope, given all these factors that there would be some considerations, specifically financially, which would be offered to me at the time of my next potential future lease, which would be in 2024.

,,,Dominic Maestas,11/29/2023,n/a,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,"As a Genesis owner, I am deeply disappointed with the company's warranty policies, serviceability, and reimbursement procedures. My recent experience with Genesis Customer Care has left me feeling frustrated, unsupported, and undervalued as a customer.

Warranty Restrictions:

Genesis' warranty is riddled with restrictions and limitations, making it difficult to get coverage for even basic repairs. The requirement to have maintenance performed at an authorized Genesis retailer is an unreasonable burden for many owners, especially those living in areas without a nearby Genesis dealership. This restriction effectively excludes owners from utilizing independent repair facilities, even if they offer superior service and expertise.

Serviceability Issues:

The lack of Genesis Service Valet availability for non-original owners is a significant inconvenience. This service, which provides pick-up and drop-off for Genesis owners, is only offered to those who purchased the vehicle new. This exclusion demonstrates a lack of consideration for existing Genesis owners who may have purchased their vehicle used or pre-owned and actuality the 1st owner of my car was the dealership itself, total nonsense.

Reimbursement Burden:

The reimbursement process for independent repair services is unnecessarily complex and burdensome. The requirement to submit a multitude of documents, including repair orders, proof of ownership, and proof of payment, creates an unnecessary hurdle for owners seeking reimbursement. Additionally, the lack of guaranteed reimbursement leaves owners at the mercy of Genesis' decision-making process, adding to the overall frustration.

Overall, Genesis' warranty, serviceability, and reimbursement policies fall far short of providing the level of support and convenience that premium car owners deserve. The company's restrictive practices and burdensome procedures leave owners feeling undervalued and unsupported.

I urge Genesis to reconsider its warranty policies and make them more customer-centric. The company should expand its authorized service network, eliminate the exclusion of non-original owners from Genesis Service Valet, and simplify the reimbursement process. By addressing these issues, Genesis can regain the trust and loyalty of its customers.",34278827,"","",11/26/2023,11/29/2023,11/29/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,29720003,,Dominic,Maestas,,maestasd@gmail.com,,,,,,,2023,Genesis,GV70,KMUMADTB8PU095569,198.206.223.251,17a2,,198.206.223.251,'Chrome 118.0.0.0','Windows 10',22373801,CA,2023/11/23 19:05:01,2023/11/24 13:15:13,Warranty,Coverage,Siebel Administrator,Genesis Email,29720003,31362096,6675663,6500,DUSTIN.CHEMERIKA,,,,Y,GENESIS COMPLIMENTARY MAINTENANCE INQUIRY; How do I get the warranty oil change coming up in 1500 miles?

I think this stems with the dealer/service department in Manchester NH.

Finally, while I have your attention, while I love my G80, I am having reservations about purchasing another as I have to travel to NH to get it serviced.

Then I received 10 reminders of my service…….. only to have the valet never show up.   Great marketing plan…….too bad it’s only lip service.  It will be back to Mercedes for me.

I chose this car specifically as it felt like a luxury vehicle more reasonably priced than a higher end car.  From day 1 my Genesis connected serviced has not worked and  I really can’t use the Apple CarPlay as it’s producing a terrible echo on the other end. For almost a month I went back and forth with customer service with them having me try the same thing over and over. Each time it took 5 days to get another response back from the engineers. They are now telling me they think they have it fixed but it requires me going to a dealership for a hard factory reset.  And they can’t get me in for a couple weeks.

Jessyca was nice, but I was busy at work and have not called her back to resolve my issue.  I am unable to remote start my car, I've read the manual numerous times, everything is as it should be, and I cannot get it figured out.  I think that she sent an email which gives the info that is in the manual.  I'll call, but not optimistic.  My second and much larger frustration is that I cannot find anyone who knows how to work on my G90 without driving two hours from home.  When I purchased, I knew of the Genesis dealership in Holland, Michigan, however after I called to get an oil change I was told that ""we no longer work on Genesis vehicles"".  I asked, ""Can't you do an oil change?""  She said, that they could but nothing else.  The next dealership closest is Kalamazoo, and they schedule nothing online so I've been unable to make arrangements because I work in emergency services and can't call during the day and they are closed on the weekends.  Which also means that I'll need to take a day off to have any work done on my car.  The trunk isn't opening with the FOB and I hear what I think is a leaf in the blower crackling around whenever I have the heat or air on.  Nothing big, but I'll need to use vacation to have someone look at that.  Also, the rear driver's side doesn't open when I park, all the others do, but not that one.

I also contacted the Service Department at Genesis of Alexandria (Virginia). The receptionist could not locate anyone in the service department and said that they would leave a message for them to call back with answers. No one called after a week.

The problem is communication from the actual recall folks.   I received a recall notice about the low pressure fuel pump problem.  The recall should have addressed prepping the car.   #1 the pump is in the fuel tank.  #2 the customer needs to bring the car in with less than 1/4 tank of gas. #3 ensure you remove items from the back of the car because the fuel pump access panel is under the rear seat.  Future customer service issues should include important prepping information that the customer should be made aware. Could have saved me a lot of running around for no reason.

,,,Mark Reagan,12/07/2023,n/a,1,2,4,2,1,1,0,"The G80 has been a nightmare. The SAT Nav failed. 5 weeks later a new head unit was installed. It failed in the dealers parking lot. It was a failed antenna. Six weeks later the new antenna was installed and immediately failed. Turns out the amplifier had failed. Again, this was at the dealer while picking it up. The new amplifier took almost six weeks to arrive. It now works. Oops, the connect software is out of date. Now needed to call and spend one hour and five minutes on the phone walking through VIN number and various serial numbers. At the end of all that, I needed to create an account to ship me a USB so I can update myself. This is absurd. My wife's Lexus does it automatically by satellite. Same for all the BMW and Mercedes cars I have owned. The repeated failures of basic electronics and the endless delays in getting replacement parts is not the hallmark of quality. Shabby is more accurate. This car has spent more time in the shop and waiting for boasts than all my cars in the last 25 years combined. 17 days in the shop and months waiting for a head unit, then an antenna and then an amplifier. Serious quality failure for a brand wanting to compete with the very best. It's pretty and drives well, but repeated electronic failures and long waits for replacement parts tell me that Genesis just doesn't care about the ownership experience. Very shabby. I was about to get an SUV or go electric with Genesis. After nine months of failure I will look elsewhere. I'm also waiting to see just how long it takes to get Genesis connect working. I'm using my totally reliable iPhone to do what my G80 should handle. We'll see when and if. Very disappointed that I believed the promise. Reality has been brutal waste of many days and hours. I doubt I'll hear back. Customer service is as bad as the electronics.

,,,Michael Torrese,12/12/2023,n/a,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,i was shocked to have the level of poor service with a brand like Genesis. I recently brought my 2023 GV70 in for scheduled maintenance and a concern with the display and some settings. I was told there was nothing found and sent on my way. The clock was not displaying the correct time after daylight savings. I called to the freehold dealership and spoke to Terrence who was my customer care rep. i was shocked at how rude and offensive he was. what ended up being so disappointing was when i called Genesis customer service and told them what i was experiencing and the woman was able to solve the issue in less than 1 minute. this could have been done very easily at the dealership. Terrence was awful and the experience was certainly not what i am accustomed to with Audi and Mercedes. ,34362842,"","",12/07/2023,12/12/2023,12/12/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,28990555,,Michael,Torrese,,mtorrese@verizon.net,,,,,,,2023,Genesis,GV70,KMUMADTB1PU125236,72.76.33.132,403a,,72.76.33.132,'Firefox 120.0.','Windows 10',22433341,CA,2023/12/05 12:38:02,2023/12/05 12:44:11,Product,Technical Assistance,GCCC Care,GCCC Care,28990555,30630129,,,ALEXIS.HERNANDEZ01,,,,Y,CLOCK SETTING ASSISTANCE,Owner unchecking daylight savings in their time settings.,ALEXIS,

Unfortunately for both Megan and myself (as well as the multiple Genesis support people I have spoken to), resolving anything outside the most basic of issues requires a ridiculous back and forth with the genesis ""engineers"", which requires a 4-7 day turnaround time after each interaction.

What frustrated me the most about this last interaction with Genesis support, is the fact that after waiting 7 days for the genesis ""engineers"" to provide a resolution for my support issue, they asked for the exact same information which was already provided to them, during one of  the previous  hour long troubleshooting sessions (one of several so far). Can you guess how long its going to take for Genesis technical support to even look at the ticket again? 5-7 days of course! 

This issue with my car and genesis connected services has, without exaggeration, taken multiple weeks SO FAR to resolve. It is absolutely ridiculous for a luxury car manufacturer to have such a stupid troubleshooting and resolution process.

I am getting really sick and tired of continuously hearing ""We expect to get a response from our technical team in 5-7 days"" after spending 70k on one of your cars.

,,,Peter Rafferty,12/13/2023,n/a,1,2,5,4,1,5,0,"I went to Piazza Hyundai and agreed to buy a new GV80, paid in cash, as we were closing the deal for the brand new car the salesman asked me if i was interested in saving some money and buy ""a just like brand new"" dealer car, 2023 GV80. I made the big mistake of trusting the salesman that it was just like brand new but after going home with the car I immediately called them because I noticed that the manager or dealer beat the shit out of the car. There were rips in fabric, scratches, indents in carpet, beat up tires, etc.. I wanted to immediately bring it back and swap for the new car I originally wanted. I was told they would fix everything in this car, they kept it for about a week and returned with one repair, they just painted the outside! I basically way over-paid for a beat up used car, I would not have agreed to that bullshit deal of saving a little money by buying the ""like new"" dealer car. I brought this issue up the chain to Hyundai/Genesis management but my case was  eventually rejected and the idiotic reason was that ""it did not meet the requirements to be considered a lemon""! I never mentioned that word so don't know how you came to that conclusion. I simply asked for either 1. a rebate to get the car fixed or 2. swap it for the new car.  I never mentioned the word lemon, my complaint was being misled by salesman and management. Internally the car is fine, but I bought a heavily damaged car, nothing very big but lots of small damages that were hidden. So I do take blame for trusting Hyundai/Genesis management but do not think my request for some refund to get the car fixed was unreasonable.

I went to the Springfield dealership and explained o Alex that I thought I might have damaged my undercarriage.  I asked Alex if he could put my car on a lift and inspect the undercarriage.  Alex had to wait until a lift was free, about 15 minutes, and then we inspected the car.  The splash shield covering the oil drain access hatch was torn and folded back.  Alex said he could get the part and replace it for @$104 plus labor.  That afternoon he called me and said he had the part and it I could bring the car back he would have it installed in a few minutes, along with a few missing bolts holding on her parts of the splash shield.  The total bill was about $145 and I couldn't
have been more pleased.  
This is my second visit to this dealership for service, and my second interaction with Alex.   I was equally pleased with my first visit.

,,,Erika Freeman,12/13/2023,n/a,4,3,4,3,3,3,10,"I've always had outstanding service with Genesis -- my only complaints so far are that the app/website doesn't always reflect the service I received at a dealership outside of my ""home"" dealership (home = where I purchased the car).  Also, the last time  I tried to schedule service, the app/website did not offer the Valet option that I receive with my car so I had to call.  

My only other issue has been with a question that I had after my last service call--> I had requested that the key in my remote be replaced because it wasn't always working/responding properly.  After service, I had asked the courtesy driver if it had been changed and he did not know.  Then I mentioned it during a phone followup survey and asked again -- no follow up or answer was received.  Thirdly (if that's a word), I listed it in one of these surveys and needless to say, I still haven't received an answer to my question.  

Besides those small issues, I love the car.  I would purchase another Genesis product but I would not purchase another electric vehicle until the infrastructure is available to use the car for long distances (I knew this going in, so that's on me).

,,,Douglas Towns,12/14/2023,n/a,1,5,5,4,1,3,5,"This continues to be a problem without resolution.  In November, I used the Genesis Connect Service to make a routine, schedule maintenance service visit. There was no available service appointments for over a month.  The Connect Representative even called the local dealership to confirm that there were no earlier appointments available, but supposedly confirmed a December appointment.  I got an email and text confirmation.  Within the last week, I got a call from the dealership that the scheduled appointment was not available.  When I call to confirm/check, I was told that the next available appointment was in March - - 4 months later.  I asked to be connected with the Service Manager that also confirmed that the Genesis Connect scheduled appointment was not accurate and could not be honored.  He volunteered that this ""this has happened before.""  I have been able to get an appointment in December, but I will now likely be outside the 36month/36,000 mile warranty.   I was told by Timothy that Genesis has made accommodations in the past on the warranty deadline, but that he didn't have the authority to approve this and that I would have to pay out of pocket and fight to get reimbursed under the warranty.  This is unfair and seems like a known issue - - it should not take 4-5 months to get a service appointment, there shouldn't be any disconnect between scheduling while customers were encouraged to use Genesis Connect to make service appointments, the warranty accommodation should be approved without further delay without the need to hope for an after-the-fact resolution.   Sorry for the lengthy email, but I do find this satisfactory and doesn't provide a strong base to recommend Genesis.  Hopefully, there is a resolution of this.  Please feel free to reach out as needed.

A month after I called and scheduled my second service, Genesis calls and tells me I will probably have to pay for that service because it hadn't been 8,000 miles/12 months sinc3 my last service.  The Representative was polite.  However he stated that when I set up the MYsomething parameters I incorrectly told the system that I was in a ""severe"" area and not a normal area and  that was why I was allowed to bring my GV80 in for service every 6 months/5,000 miles.  I never set up anything on that car.  The dealership did all that.  I live in the Phoenix area and maybe they do that because this is a very poluted and dusty area.  I don't know.

MD703,45714,Genesis Of Rockville,Robert Shapiro,12/30/2023,n/a,1,2,4,3,1,1,0,"Genesis “service” is a disaster.  I called to set up valet service for an oil change.  The call took 22+ minutes, and did not result in an appointment.  Such appointments can only be made by the single individual at each dealership that is responsible for Genesis, and such individuals never, ever pickup the phone.  When I later heard from one such individual, they said the belt service old only be scheduled for 2 months out.  It’s insulting to claim to offer the service, but have it be so useless (nobody schedules oil changes months in advance).  It’s actually unlawful to claim a customer will receive a service but then make it unavailable for practical purposes.  Jamie took forever to find out that the one Genesis service advisor at each dealership was unavailable.  And she waisted a  lot of my time unctiously thanking me for my pittance and for permission to put me on hold for the 5th time.  Months ago, I had a similarly unsuccessful call trying to get roof rack cross bars for my car; I was told that I was shit out of luck, because they were unavailable.  I called around myself and found. Dealer who could get a pair who charged N extortionate amount to install them.  Then there was the episode soon after purchasing the car when it was in the shop for 6 weeks waiting for a part to fix the faulty electronic anti slip differential.  When it first gave a warning light, e Genesis advisor told me to ignore it, even though I later found out that it was a well-known issue.  I had it tied in later after its failure caused a very dangerous situation.  Then there’s the Apple CarPlay that requires plugging in my phone, but when the phone is plugged in, Spotify sound quality is ruined.  A software upgrade could fix that situation, but it’s not happening.",34546532,"","",12/30/2023,12/30/2023,12/30/2023,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,26522628,,Robert,Shapiro,,shapirorl@gmail.com,,,,,,,2023,Genesis,GV70,KMUMCDTC5PU086086,173.66.59.204,b8b1,,173.66.59.204,'Mobile Safari 17.1.2','iOS 17.1.2',22550373,CA,2023/12/28 15:22:14,2023/12/28 15:58:25,Service Link,Schedule Maintenance,GCCC Care,GCCC Care,26522628,28233021,5805129,,JAMIE.PARCHESKY,MID-ATLANTIC,Genesis Mid Atlantic District,MD703,Y,GENESIS BRAND - GCS SERVICE LINK ASSISTANCE,Owner will wait for the RTLRs to contact him back directly to finish setting up the APPT.,JAMIE,
