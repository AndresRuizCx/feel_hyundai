NC711,45702,Genesis Of Concord,Darryl King,04/28/2024,n/a,1,5,5,3,2,1,0,"I appreciate Delores' assistance. While she did an admiral job, she could not solve my issue. She went above and beyond and contacted the dealer. We jointly spoke with the parts and service departments. My problem started on March 23rd when I took my car in for service after a service engine light appeared on my dash (BTW, it took 3.5 weeks to get an appointment; extremely poor). The technician diagnosed the issue and advised the Service Advisor of the problem. It was determined that a part needed to be ordered. The service advisor said it would take several days and scheduled me for a follow-up appointment on March 25th. He stated he would call me when the part arrived. It arrived, but I was never called back. Even after leaving several messages for the service advisor, I never receive a returned phone call. Therefore, I reached out to Customer Care and spoke with Delores. When we talked to the local dealer jointly, they confirmed that the part was on-site and ensured they would schedule me the next day. He said I would be receiving a call; of course, I did not. I am still awaiting service, and it's now been five weeks. I am deeply disappointed with Genesis and feel compelled to alert others to Genesis's poor service. As it stands, I have a car that Genesis apparently does not want to fix; even after ordering parts. 
If you care to speak with me, I can be reached at 704-804-3570. The proper resolution to this matter would be to arrange for immediate service. Unfortunately, I am having major surgery on April 30th and will be unable to have the car taken to the repair center. This surgery is crucial, and I need my car to be in a reliable condition before then. I would also like my service to be covered by warranty.  Finally, I want the dealership to be reprimanded and dealt with appropriately for their lack of attentiveness and commitment to customer satisfaction.

The display offered a ‘service line’ option, which I selected. I was connected to Genesis Connect. I explained the issue and  I had a 6 hour drive back home on Sunday.  Vanessa told me it was probably ok to drive it 6 hours because the check engine light wasn’t flashing. I looked in the Genesis forums and saw various comments about the misfire code.  I didn’t feel good about Vanessa’s advice and called my dealership Saturday morning.  I was able to speak to a technician who advised me to bring it to a Genesis dealership nearby. Closest was an hour away (the closer Hyundai dealership no longer services Genesis).  The local dealership agreed it was best to have it checked before the long drive.

There has been a safety recall but the closest Genesis dealer is now 73+ miles away in Kirkland, WA.  The service department is willing to meet me in Mount Vernon, WA but it means that I either have to drive to Mt. Vernon myself - 30 miles away or get a driver to take me there.  I can drive on the freeway but do not do so very often since I am 85 years old.  I still consider myself a good driver but tend to only drive my car short distances.  So, I contacted both the Kirkland dealership through their web page (no answer yet) and decided to call Genesis customer care to express my disappointment and frustration over not having the dealer picking the car up at my residence.  I feel since it is a company recall that the closest dealership should pick it up no matter the distance.  And, I am not sure where I will be able to get normal service done for my 2021 Genesis once the warranty is up.

In a nutshell, I bought a GV60 performance and was supposed to have the valet service for service visits.  Apparently (after several calls with the dealer), the dealer knows nothing about that service, and requires that I drop the car off personally in order to have the recall fixed.   I tried calling Genesis Customer Care at Genesis Motor America and they didn't care, and said something like, ""I guess some dealers don't offer that service...Can I help you with something else"".   I'm very disappointed with Genesis'  efforts to sell me on this car with features like the valet service for 3 years,, and now that I have it, they are not willing to honor it.  I am also very dissatisfied with the lack of attention to this matter.  I have not received ANY reply to my comments for Case number is 23192541.   Frankly, I don't care so much about the valet service, but I am really annoyed that I was promised something and now Hyundai/Genesis doesn't care about actually delivering on their service.  I could have bought any car I wanted, but I wanted to give Genesis a try.  It was a big mistake. I simply don't trust that Genesis will honor its commitments.

He told me how to get the vehicle switched over to me in your system and described the Genesis Connect service in detail (which was the reason for my call).
The only reason I did not give the highest score for resolving the issue is that I am still upset that owners of 2023 and newer get this service for free but since I own a 2022 I have to pay for it.
The representative was able to give me a discount ( for 1 year)  but I am not happy that I have to pay anything when others are getting it at no additional cost. Note I do not blame the representative for this as I'm sure he didn't have the authority to give it to me at no cost.

,,,Heather Kwok,05/04/2024,n/a,2,2,2,2,1,1,3,"I needed to schedule my GV70 EV regular maintenance appointment. I used the app in the car to call to make an appointment. Timothy was courteous but had to put me on a hold to call the local dealer to schedule. He came back a few times to tell me that he was still trying to get through to them. 10 minutes later he came back to let me know he was still trying to reach them (not his fault) and I had to leave my car so had to end the call. He said he'd call me back once he got an appointment but I never heard back from him. It would have been good to get a call back since he offered that. I had to go through the process separately again to get an appointment scheduled. I would say that overall Genesis' dealership service department experience has been terrible. We got hit and the body shop needed to order parts and they literally could not get a hold of anyone or a response from the parts department for weeks. I finally called the dealership sales department twice, first time no luck in getting a response, second time they gave me the parts persons email and finally responded. The parts person told me that he doesn't listen and respond to voicemails. What?!? I think the parts department at the Kirkland dealership needs to staff more people to fill this vital role since there is only one employee in Washington State dealing with parts and he obviously seems swamped and unable to do the bare minimum of responding to calls, voicemails and emails.  Genesis really needs to put more resources towards customer service on the local level since Genesis is getting a bad rep online in this regard and losing potential sales because people who can afford these EV cars do not want to go through all this hassle and poor customer experience, for a premium car this is NOT a premium experience and people will take their purchasing power elsewhere unless this gets resolved. I love my car but would not buy one in the future if this continues to be the trend in the local service levels.

My other concern was that Electrify America, whom Genesis contracted with for 3 years of free charging for my Electrified G80, won’t honor the promotion, saying my promo code (the engine code for my car) has already been used. EA has horrible customer care and a 1.5 out of 5 rating, and I have contacted them 4 times about the free charging, gotten conflicting answers, and never been called back by a supervisor despite a promise to. When I turned to Genesis for assistance, I was told it was a dealer issue, not a Genesis issue.
This is my third Genesis (2015 Equus, traded for a new 2019 G90, and now the new Electrified G80); you folks contracted with EA, not the dealer. If you want to keep former Mercedes buyers (like me, I had 3 of those) and other luxury brand consumers, you have to deliver that level of post purchase customer service.

I own a GV 80 purchased in Fort Wayne Indiana. Juan was very nice thank you. However we do not have a genesis dealership in Fort Wayne any more. Furthermore I feel that we the end user takes it on the chin…….for the mistakes or reasons why Fort Wayne is gone. Now I would think that Genesis would be doing there best to make things right as it’s not my fault why that dealership was lost. I am forced to look at your competitors who are rolling up there sleeves to win over your existing customers. So with my experience in Fort Wayne to put it quite frankly…..it was less than good. Now what should I do? I tried calling, emailing just to communicate my thoughts and concerns only to fall on deaf ears. Please be assured of my point of view and the shoulders I rub day to day! Perhaps someone will read this and be concerned. Not to sure……I will be looking for a new car very soon with a company who cares for there customers.

But as Genesis doesn't have a Dealership in El Paso, TX anymore; so, Ashley promised to call me back next day, and to inform me about the arrangement that she will make with the Genesis Dealership in Arizona, to send a Truck and take my SUV to be fixed. 
So far, Ashely didn't call and my SUV still leaking I don't know what kind of liquid. Genesis was informed and send a Text message informing me about the leak, but no one has acted so far to provide a service that is under warranty. I do assure you that if by next Monday Genesis does not provide any convenient solution, I will ask my Lawyer to take care of this and other issues that my SUV has, which was never repaired by your local Ex-Dealership.  my GV80 has 28,000 miles approximately.

So my feedback is that open chat should do a quality check that the dealership followed through w what the caller reached out for.",35558463,"","",05/12/2024,05/12/2024,05/12/2024,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,30839251,,Betsy,Chouinard,,betsychouinard@yahoo.com,,,,,,,2024,Genesis,GV80,KMUHCESC7RU161625,174.224.173.42,df67,,174.224.173.42,'Mobile Safari 17.4.1','iOS 17.4.1',22780295,CA,2024/02/12 14:06:38,2024/05/10 14:57:24,Remote Services,Functionality Concerns,GCCC Care,GCS JIRA,30839251,32504684,,,ASHLEY.VILLA,,,,Y,GCS SERVICE ACTIVATION - enrolled failure, Ticket Submitted to Engineers 02/14/2024- Closed   TICKET ISSUED FOR DEVICE STATUS PRE RDR,ASHLEY,

GA715,45709,Genesis Of Kennesaw,Bart Malencia,05/12/2024,n/a,3,5,5,3,2,5,1,"Ciara was great!!  But due to how Genesis runs it's business, there was nothing she could do.  She was able to add clarity to my question about a recent recall of my 2020 G70.  As per Ciara, it's up to the local retailer to determine their processes and how they treat customers.  The issue is the dealer won't order the part, though it's well know as my car is part of the safety recall, until they have the car in hand.  The dealer stated that I have to drop it off and it will be 3 or 4 days until I get it back.  Yes, they are going to give me a loaner for the duration.  But that's not the point.  What should be able to be resolved in one day / one visit to the dealer across town will now take 2 visits.  

My wife is on her third Lexus.  I've had Audis, BMWs, and Mercedes cars.  I would compare the Genesis vehicles, mine included, to the other luxury providers.  Comparatively though, Genesis service is Chevy / Kia level at best.  Until Genesis has the dealer network treat customers at the scale of other luxury providers, Genesis will be a second-tier provider that has to keep discounting cars to compete.  

I hope you forward this to executive management of Genesis USA and they take appropriate action.  I'm going to be due for a new car soon.  I'd like to really consider a Genesis.  But an abysmal service experience for a luxury brand will ensure I choice another brand.

Please feel free to contact me if someone in management would like to discuss.

No matter where the POI I wanted was located (several places in Michigan), the website only returned places with similar names near Cupertino, CA. Even putting in the full address from Google Maps didn't change the outcome. Fortunately, when I tried the website search the next day before the trip it had been fixed and I was able to send meaningful addresses to my car.  While Paul may not have been able to help me due to confusion about the problem, I really appreciating his attempt to contact me in person via the phone. Kudos!!
