safety issue and my car will be rejected when it's time for inspection.
I have been waiting approximately 7 months for the part that is supposed to rid my car of the ""check engine light"".  The dealer wants to sell the cars, 
but can't fix them because my car's part is on back-order. I'm very frustrated and angry that this is still happening. 
I'm a disabled combat veteran with PTSD and other disabilities and am treated this way.

We were going to go for a run and wanted to only take our phone and no keys. So we stopped at a gas station and the palisade locked just fine. We left our key in the vehicle because of having the digital key on our phone and the blue link app. So we got done at the gas station and I went onto the app to unlock the palisade and nothing would happen. We tried it several times, still nothing. So we called customer service. The lady didn’t really know what to do for us. She said it must be the coverage area but we were at a gas station in the middle of a busy city. I had plenty of bars on my phone. So the lady told us that we would need to get someone to go and get our other key at home and basically there was nothing else to do for us. She tried unlocking it on her end and it wouldn’t work. Well unbeknownst to us, our palisade had decided to update the software while we were in the gas station!!!! We had not pushed for this to occur or anything. So we had no service with our palisade until that update finished. It would be nice if Hyundai could let their customer service reps know that this type of thing can happen to the vehicle so that the customers will never leave the vehicle without their keys.

,,,David Zagumny,05/11/2024,n/a,1,3,2,1,1,1,5,,"My 2022 Sonata Hybrid LImited recently experienced a problem with the nav system and it needs to be updated. The dealer said it was strictly a DIY issue because it’s too time consuming. I tried downloading the navigation update several times. It is extremely NOT user friendly. Everyone I talked to at the dealership said it took several hrs to load the update execute file. They were right. After several attempts I finally let it run overnight and it said it was still downloading. I thought it just may be a glitch so I started downloading the nav files which was (step 2).  After 2 more hrs. that portion at least said it was finished. I thought at that point I was good to go for installation in the car. BOY, was I wrong. It did run for about an hr. of the two that they thought it would take then stopped mid update. Now, before you ask, my laptop had 750g of open memory and I used a new 64G USB stick.
I have contacted Hyundai Customer Support and Blue Link Customer Care. They were not any help except to tell me I could purchase an update memory stick for $25. In my past vehicles even when the nav system needed updating you could still use it unless you ran into a new area. Sadly, right now the system is completely inoperable. Which leads me to believe that this is Hyundai’s way of getting me to buy the update or spend hrs trying to download a useless, frustrating program. I also saw where you are now updating the nav system every 6 months. Imagine my joy of possibly having to do this every 6 months.

Unlike any other subscription I have, I was told I could not renew until the expiration of my current subscription.  That is lunacy.  I should be able to renew and just have the renewal begin once the current subscription ends.  But I was told I had two options:  I could cancel my current subscription and begin a new one or I could wait until the current subscription lapses and then renew.  Both options are idiotic.  Why should I have to give up on days or weeks of my current subscription to renew?  Or why should I be without Blue Link for any period of time if I am unable to renew on the exact day after my current subscription expires?  Plus I was told I could not renew by phone.  I had to renew online.  What if I have an issue renewing online?  How do I resolve that?  I should be able to renew with a representative on the phone especially given the fact that I have to do it before heading out on the road the day after my current subscription expires under these stupid rules.

Lasheldria worked with me for over an hour trying to get a number of functions to work properly.  The voice activated function still does not work.  I was told the software had to be updated, which I have to do through a third party vendor. When selling a Hyundai owner a new package a software update should be included.  I paid $536, full price for a two year package, and was promised a 40% discount that was later denied, and still do not have a completely working blue link package, that Lasheldria was unable to fix , although she did fix other problems.

This directed me to call Customer Care to ""properly assist with applying any promos to my account.""  I just did this and the only way I could receive the promo discount that was emailed to me prior to my subscription expiring was to CANCEL my Bluelink for 7 or more days while the refund to my credit card processed then call back in, wait on hold again and ask to have my account reactivated with the 40%discount applied.  I chose NOT to be without my Bluelink connection for 7 or more days, not to go through the hassle of calling back in AND BE OUT the 40% discount I was offered.  Why offer a discount then set it up so that it is next to impossible to apply that discount and renew at the time the email offers it.  That shouts of DECEPTIVE BUSINES PRACTICE!  Frankly, I am disappointed in you HyundaI Bluelink!!
My satisfaction with the 2021 Hyundai Kona remains above satisfactory.  I love my car and I am pleased with the service I have received from the dealership.  However, I cannot say as much for dealing with Bluelink as it is connected to Hyundai.
