I travel with my work everyday. I am now 3 days without a car while they debate on fixing the problem they created. It defeats the purpose of my purchase with them. I would not purchase another Hyundai at this point. I am considering trading it in as it is not what I purchased in a relationship with a brand. The individuals I have had direct contact with have been pleasant and I have appreciated their help. Whoever past them is concerned about a dollar and not honoring the service contract will lose a customer over treating me like I have done something wrong. I have a warranty and the extra services I purchased at the original signing. I would not take the vehicle elsewhere as I paid to have these services here. Logically this process is not making sense.

This is what happened. 


Spent 3 hours in the service department for an oil change. Got nothing done. I asked the service manager every 1hr about it and they never explained what was going on with my car. After 3 hrs. I asked them to give me my vehicle back because I had to go to work. They finally gave it back, as I was leaving, I checked the oil cap on top of the motor was not in its place and they didn't even do the oil change. Victor Maintenace rep. was nowhere to be found and the mechanic Jiovani (mechanic) was walking around not doing anything. I bought 3 vehicles from this place, and they never treated me like this. I will never be coming back to this dealership ever again and I will not refer this place to anyone.

Also, I started to get nervous after I heard a lady speaking on the phone saying she got a brand-new motor in her vehicle, and they forgot to put water in it and the 2nd engine broke as well. That's why I checked on my engine oil level and cap. Be very careful when you drive out of this place. I will report them with the BBB as well.

,,,Art Furman,06/03/2024,n/a,1,3,1,1,1,2,10,,"The representative was very courteous and was attempting to secure an appointment for us to get a “check engine light”  diagnosed.  
It had just come on with NO indication and vehicle was running fine.  
She had almost had us an appointment which would have had us drive 2 hours from St George, Utah to a Hyundai dealership 2 hrs away in Las Vegas!!
Fortunately for us the phone call was dropped!
We never did receive a call back phone call!
That shouldn’t have happened us not getting a return call.  Unless our records weren’t in  Hyundai?
I was on my cell discussing our situation with the representative for approximately 10 minutes and she felt it was urgent to get help for our vehicle.  
I ended up going to an Auto Zone  and had them run a free system check - it turned out that the problem was a loose gas cap.  

1) Maybe in Hyundai’s assistance protocol there needs to be a checklist all customer reps have in front of them to troubleshoot with me the customer?
2) Have all customer reps ask and take down the customers number in case of a dropped call.

We love our 2023 Hyundai Tucson Hybrid!!
Thanks

I called AAA to open my car. 3 days pass by and still no activation  for a customer of 3 years when im already in your system!!! Very poor response for this service. So I cancelled it.

Not her fault. The low rating related to the brand question is also not a reflection on her (she was outstanding). I've had numerous issues with the car (mostly minor) that they never even want to resolve, let alone resolving. Wait times are excessively long for even the most basic services. Also, that whole traffic light camera alert that you can't turn off is annoying enough to cause to look at other brands in the future. Who the hell thought that it a good idea to not allow drivers to disable that alert? The drive assist functions are unreliable and not well done.

This person couldn't find any information to ""verify"" who I was, even though the person I spoke with first used the same information and also I WAS TRANSFERRED OVER, why do I need to re-verify who I am? Then, even though it felt like a big deal to give them the phone number I was calling from in order that they can call me back if we get disconnected (it was not the phone I use for making customer service calls, but it is the phone that has the blue link app and it was more convenient at the time, so I needed to make sure why they needed *this* phone number), when we did, in fact, become disconnected, I never received a call back, so what the heck??!! why make a big deal out of something that is irrelevant?

The first person I spoke with was an absolute joy, so I hope I'm not remembering the names incorrectly (don't remember either, actually). Though, she did promise to email me the case # and never did.

I can't recommend Hyundai because you have a major problem with the dealerships. Twice now we've leased a Hyundai and both times (different dealerships) we've been lied to (major lies, not just, oh, we don't have it in white when they don't want to clean out the white one, or something silly like that) and they don't seem to be very familiar with the cars they sell, telling us all sorts of incorrect or misleading information.  I've also done business with a major Ford dealership and they are lovely. Next time we'll probably buy used, so we'll keep an eye on the inventory of the used-car portion of that Ford dealership as our lease comes close to ending, or maybe we'll get a Mach-E.  The Chevy dealership my daughter used and the BMW dealership we used (2 of them, in order to get the one I wanted) were also super lovely. I was also VERY disappointed that there wasn't good guidance from Hyundai (even though I called for guidance) when coming up to the end of the lease, it included more lies on the part of the dealership which caused a lot of problems and worry for us. It's a 1 and not a 0 because the Ioniq 5 is a good car (except for the recalls and being sold one that had an open recall, which is illegal).",35770200,Low Score 2 & 3 Star Response,"",06/07/2024,06/07/2024,06/07/2024,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,22892628,,Amy,Curtin,,wcurtin@earthlink.net,,,,,,,2024,Hyundai,IONIQ 5,KM8KN4DE2RU269982,99.189.4.106,a3ba,,99.189.4.106,'Safari 17.5','Mac OS X 10.15.7',23391606,CA,2024/06/05 08:16:27,2024/06/05 08:48:38,Blue Link,Feature/Function,HCCC General,BLCC General,22892628,24538471,4493232,1929,THERESA.ANDERSONCOLL,Western Region,Western District 4,CA400,Y,"2024 IONIQ 5 - Model Matrix; 2024 IONIQ 5; CUST is having technical difficulties with the VEH alarm going off when she tries to use the key fob to unlock the VEH.

,,,Maxine Hetherington,06/08/2024,n/a,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,,"On 6/6 my car experienced complete hybrid/ekectrical failure.  Can't contact BlueLink when car is dead.  My phone is dated, won't install upgrade.  My car was in for routine maintenance at Reed Hyundai,  Kansas City on 6/5 so I had to call them to get BlueLink phone number.  Phone battery was low and 10 minute wait in a black car unable to open windows to get Blue Link to answer was excruciating.   I had also called AAA who said they were coming, but after 2 hours in the heat with no shade,  getting sick, and almost no phone battery I had to call 911 to get help from the local police.  My car had to be towed to the nearest dealer in Muskogee,  Oklahoma.   I had to pay $545 for the emergency tow and expect to be reimbursed.   If I had not acted, I may have needed to call an ambulance for treatment of heat stroke.  The Muskogee dealer said it was fixed on 6/7, but on driving again, there was the same problem 50 miles south of Muskogee.  Towed back, no chance of fixing before 6/10.   Dealer said no loaner car available,  did not offer rental car, and I am stranded in Muskogee until at least 6/10.  I expect reimbursement from Hyundai for the (at least) 4 days of hotel necessary.  I am very unhappy, which I am sure you can understand.

To Hyundai however, it’s pretty lousy that you guage your owners to spend hundreds of $$s a year to be able to auto start their vehicles when the rest of the manufacturers offer auto start from their key fobs at no cost. I am paying for the service out of necessity for the moment but am researching what after market equipment I can install to discounting this stinky charge! I will not again purchase a vehicle that does offer this as standard equipment without additional charges. Get with the times Hyundai and stop cheating your customers who spend top dollars for their vehicles. It’s really an awful way to do business!
