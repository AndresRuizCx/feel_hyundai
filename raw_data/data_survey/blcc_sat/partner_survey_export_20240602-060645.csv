,,,David Zagumny,05/11/2024,n/a,1,3,2,1,1,1,5,,"My 2022 Sonata Hybrid LImited recently experienced a problem with the nav system and it needs to be updated. The dealer said it was strictly a DIY issue because it’s too time consuming. I tried downloading the navigation update several times. It is extremely NOT user friendly. Everyone I talked to at the dealership said it took several hrs to load the update execute file. They were right. After several attempts I finally let it run overnight and it said it was still downloading. I thought it just may be a glitch so I started downloading the nav files which was (step 2).  After 2 more hrs. that portion at least said it was finished. I thought at that point I was good to go for installation in the car. BOY, was I wrong. It did run for about an hr. of the two that they thought it would take then stopped mid update. Now, before you ask, my laptop had 750g of open memory and I used a new 64G USB stick.
I have contacted Hyundai Customer Support and Blue Link Customer Care. They were not any help except to tell me I could purchase an update memory stick for $25. In my past vehicles even when the nav system needed updating you could still use it unless you ran into a new area. Sadly, right now the system is completely inoperable. Which leads me to believe that this is Hyundai’s way of getting me to buy the update or spend hrs trying to download a useless, frustrating program. I also saw where you are now updating the nav system every 6 months. Imagine my joy of possibly having to do this every 6 months.

Unlike any other subscription I have, I was told I could not renew until the expiration of my current subscription.  That is lunacy.  I should be able to renew and just have the renewal begin once the current subscription ends.  But I was told I had two options:  I could cancel my current subscription and begin a new one or I could wait until the current subscription lapses and then renew.  Both options are idiotic.  Why should I have to give up on days or weeks of my current subscription to renew?  Or why should I be without Blue Link for any period of time if I am unable to renew on the exact day after my current subscription expires?  Plus I was told I could not renew by phone.  I had to renew online.  What if I have an issue renewing online?  How do I resolve that?  I should be able to renew with a representative on the phone especially given the fact that I have to do it before heading out on the road the day after my current subscription expires under these stupid rules.  That gives me a very mall window to do it on the morning of May 24th.

Lasheldria worked with me for over an hour trying to get a number of functions to work properly.  The voice activated function still does not work.  I was told the software had to be updated, which I have to do through a third party vendor. When selling a Hyundai owner a new package a software update should be included.  I paid $536, full price for a two year package, and was promised a 40% discount that was later denied, and still do not have a completely working blue link package, that Lasheldria was unable to fix , although she did fix other problems.

This directed me to call Customer Care to ""properly assist with applying any promos to my account.""  I just did this and the only way I could receive the promo discount that was emailed to me prior to my subscription expiring was to CANCEL my Bluelink for 7 or more days while the refund to my credit card processed then call back in, wait on hold again and ask to have my account reactivated with the 40%discount applied.  I chose NOT to be without my Bluelink connection for 7 or more days, not to go through the hassle of calling back in AND BE OUT the 40% discount I was offered.  Why offer a discount then set it up so that it is next to impossible to apply that discount and renew at the time the email offers it.  That shouts of DECEPTIVE BUSINES PRACTICE!  Frankly, I am disappointed in you HyundaI Bluelink!!
My satisfaction with the 2021 Hyundai Kona remains above satisfactory.  I love my car and I am pleased with the service I have received from the dealership.  However, I cannot say as much for dealing with Bluelink as it is connected to Hyundai.

I just got off the phone with Saagar who was trying to help me get my phone connected to my car. My phone would connect without the need for a usb cord before the dealership’s  Blue Link subscription expired.  Now, we cannot get the phone to connect. I am frustrated. I will call again later this afternoon and hopefully someone can explain how to get my phone to connect with using a  phone cord attached to the usb port.",35640659,Low Score 2 & 3 Star Response,"",05/22/2024,05/22/2024,05/22/2024,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,22097688,,Deborah,Herbert,,debherbert24@gmail.com,,,,,,,2021,Hyundai,Palisade,KM8R5DHE8MU216219,75.227.190.136,b6d0,,75.227.190.136,'Safari 17.4.1','Mac OS X 10.15.7',23302547,CA,2024/05/19 13:40:06,2024/05/20 14:22:59,Account Management,Change of Information,Siebel Administrator,BLCC General,22097688,23729430,4295330,,CIERRIA.FREEMAN,,,,Y,MYHYUNDAI MERGE REQUEST; Needs to update email associated with account.

I travel with my work everyday. I am now 3 days without a car while they debate on fixing the problem they created. It defeats the purpose of my purchase with them. I would not purchase another Hyundai at this point. I am considering trading it in as it is not what I purchased in a relationship with a brand. The individuals I have had direct contact with have been pleasant and I have appreciated their help. Whoever past them is concerned about a dollar and not honoring the service contract will lose a customer over treating me like I have done something wrong. I have a warranty and the extra services I purchased at the original signing. I would not take the vehicle elsewhere as I paid to have these services here. Logically this process is not making sense. I do not have a loaner, I am not being treated as a customer paying for the vehicle and expecting to have use of said vehicle, and communication is breaking down.

This is what happened. 


Spent 3 hours in the service department for an oil change. Got nothing done. I asked the service manager every 1hr about it and they never explained what was going on with my car. After 3 hrs. I asked them to give me my vehicle back because I had to go to work. They finally gave it back, as I was leaving, I checked the oil cap on top of the motor was not in its place and they didn't even do the oil change. Victor Maintenace rep. was nowhere to be found and the mechanic Jiovani (mechanic) was walking around not doing anything. I bought 3 vehicles from this place, and they never treated me like this. I will never be coming back to this dealership ever again and I will not refer this place to anyone.

Also, I started to get nervous after I heard a lady speaking on the phone saying she got a brand-new motor in her vehicle, and they forgot to put water in it and the 2nd engine broke as well. That's why I checked on my engine oil level and cap. Be very careful when you drive out of this place. I will report them with the BBB as well.
