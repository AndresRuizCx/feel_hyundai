,,,Charles George,05/06/2024,n/a,2,4,5,2,1,1,3,,"Also I’m a bit unhappy about the procedural difficulty in transferring ownership to me because it’s my understanding that this vehicle while previously sold developed difficulties with the cooling system and that Hyundai chose to take the vehicle back, provide previous owner with a different vehicle and then do a factory level repair then release the vehicle for resale as if new with full warrantee.  It seems to me the previous owner data should have been wiped and car sold as if new so that my purchase and attempts to register as new owner were the same as any other new buyer.   I attempted to get local dealer assistance with this process it was unsuccessful.  Using the website (not the app which went no where) I managed to begin this process more as if I’d purchased from a private sale than purchased through legitimate professional dealership.  This problem should be resolved in the preparation for professional resale steps rather than expecting a new (and unfamiliar) buyer to solve the supply chain communication difficulties to obtain the advertised benefits of “My Hyundai” and “Blue link” sevices.

,,,Caroline Capps,05/11/2024,n/a,1,1,1,1,1,2,7,,"I loved my 2012 Hyundai Accent, but I traded it in last December (in part because of the fire hazard recall that has yet to be resolved). I contacted Hyundai USA on 4/10/24, requesting that I be removed from all national and dealer mailing lists. I received a reply addressed to someone other than me (although I know the car has yet to be resold). I followed the directions in the email for removing my car from your system. I then received an email thanking me for REGISTERING my vehicle. I called today (5/11/24) and spoke with a representative who informed me that I must contact the DMV and my original dealer if I want to be stop receiving mailings. The DMV??? Really??? The DMV knew that I no longer owned the card in DECEMBER. I will contact my original dealer and request that I be removed from their mailing list. I find that my experience with Customer Care was unsatisfactory--from the automated menu selections to the ultimate inability to resolve this problem. Moreover, this feedback form asked me to rate someone named Mason, and I have never had any contact with said Mason. (I therefore had no choice in rating Mason, so please don't hold the ratings against him) I did not need Customer Care during the 12 years I owned my Accent, and this experience made me grateful for that.

The representative was very nice and professional and courteous towards me, but in general inquiry was not answered in the way I would like for it to be. I had received an email that my recall was ready in general, but the lady had informed me just not for my make or model for my Hyundai. So that was overall disappointing. I say that because it’s been months since I’ve been waiting for a solution for the recall and when it says it’s ready; it’s really not. When I asked her what happens otherwise and she says car fires within structures, etc. And that doesn’t sound very safe to me because I park at a car garage for when I have three appointments per week and I normally park in a garage in my house to protect my car from outside elements. So I was not very happy to hear about this and how it could impact me at a higher risk because of how I should park. I mean, I guess I could park out on the street when I’m at home I rather not but I will for safety wise. But when I have my appointments. I have no choice but to park in a car garage because there is no street parking.  in general was just disappointed that there was solution and I hope to get the letter soon.

When we call to get answers/check in, we are met with silence (no response) or we are told they will contact us by a certain day/time and then they don’t. We were not provided with the information that we needed to know in order to have the repairs made how they needed to be under warranty. We know that there is a process and timeline for things to happen, but we felt that AGAIN, the communication we got was not only poor but unacceptable.

When they would leave a message they wouldn’t say what it is about. So I would call and spend many minutes holding just to be told that they are working on the issue. Really?

Also, My electrify america 3rd year free charging issue where I was not given a 3rd year free charging as a result of paying to reserve my Ionic when purchased was NEVER RESOLVED. I spent MONTHS on the phone and emailing with Hyundai, Electrify America, and Brannan Hyundai Dealership without any assistance. Each party blames the other and I am the one left with the issue unresolved and nobody at Hyundai seems to care!

Brittney thoroughly researched the situation and replied that unfortunately, company policy required performance of both actions to do either one. However, she was also able to confirm that if I had a corrosion treatment done by a third party and submitted it to the Hyundai dealer for compliance  inspection, they could then perform the 251 recall action.  I was disappointed that Hyundai policy prevented my immediately having only the critical fire prevention action completed,  but at least I was offered an option for satisfying the corrosion treatment requirement.

If she is the person I talked to on the phone with Round Rock Hyundai, then the only way she could help me was sending me to another dealership for repair work.  Both of my rear shocks were leaking.  It was hard for me to believe that Round Rock Hyundai could not get me in until October and South Point Hyundai could not get me in until August.  That is ridiculous.  However, when I called Killeen Hyundai (60 miles away) I had an appointment in 2 days.  The Service Manager (Joe) and Customer Care Representative Halie took very good care of me and got me out in 1 day.  They also took care of the recalls on my Palisades.  The customer waiting area and lounge was spotless and very inviting.  I felt like a VIP.  I have nothing but good things to say about Killeen Hyundai.  My only other experience with a Hyundai dealership concerning maintenance was when I made an appointment with Round Rock Hyundai 2 years ago and it took 5 hours for them to do a free oil change.  Needless to say, I did not go back for my other two free oil changes.   While I have been very satisfied with the performance of my Hyundai Palisades, I have not been impressed with the amount of hassle involved with any maintenance/repair work necessary at the local dealerships.  The Service Manager at the Killeen Hyundai said that he was servicing cars from Dallas, Austin, San Antonio and now Hutto, where I live.  Makes me have to think twice about buying another Hyundai, if it is going to be this big a hassle to get one repaired/maintenanced  at a dealership.",35551145,Low Score 2 & 3 Star Response,"",05/11/2024,05/15/2024,05/15/2024,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,22022322,,Gordon,Vansickle,,vansickles55@austin.rr.com,,,,,,,2021,Hyundai,Palisade,KM8R7DHE6MU254347,38.186.106.211,2cdc,,38.186.106.211,'Chrome 124.0.0.0','Windows 10',23252266,CA,2024/05/09 10:02:10,2024/05/09 10:18:34,Campaign,223 Seat Belt Pretensioner,HCCC General,HCCC General,22022322,23650714,4136866,32402,KRYSTAL.JONES,,,,Y,RECALL 233 INQUIRY,appointment scheduled,KRYSTAL,

I cannot believe that for the rest of the time that I own my 2015 Hyundai Elantra, I am going to have to continuously be fearful of someone trying to take it. I regret ever getting the software update because it did absolutely nothing to benefit me. My insurance doesn’t cover a rental unless my car is PHYSICALLY stolen, so what am I supposed to do when someone smashes my window and ruins the steering wheel? You’d think Hyundai would offer a FREE rental car to customers who are impacted by this, but that must be asking WAY too much of a company who KNOWINGLY sold these defective cars!!! It’s absolutely unbelievable. I am out thousands of dollars because of this company. Now Hyundai is saying there’s another recall on my car, and there is not yet a solution. So in the meantime, don’t park in the garage. Are you kidding me?? I NEED to park in my garage to keep my car safe from attempted theft!!! Unless I want to fork over THOUSANDS of dollars yet again? What a customer experience this has been… and then Hyundai won’t even give me a steering wheel lock because I’m no longer eligible due to receiving the software update. At least my local police department has enough sense to hand them out for free, thank goodness I was able to get one from them. Finally someone who LISTENS. Hyundai says they’ve “done their part” (that’s a quote directly from your representative) by giving me the free software update. Like I said, I absolutely regret getting that update because it has done nothing but screw me over. The thieves can have that piece of crap car for all I care. Then at least I’d get a free rental from my insurance AND God willing if it’s missing long enough, an insurance payout so I can buy a different vehicle that’s NOT a Hyundai and then and only then will my issue be resolved. Until then, this car has become my ball and chain. Thank you for the absolute worst customer experiences I’ve ever had in my life. Anytime someone is considering a Hyundai I tell them to stay away.

It has been going on for several years and after following Corporate's instructions, I still don't have an answer to whether or not Hyundai is going to do the right thing and take care of the problem.  When I purchased this vehicle, I was charged extra because this was a ""custom paint"".  I would have been better off with a traditional paint, as they have not had the problem that this paint has had.  After having them cancel two appointments, I took my car to Lynne's Hyundai in Bloomfield, NJ, more that an hour from where I live, on March 4th.  I was told it would take about a week before I heard from Corporate after seeing the pictures of my car that were taken at Lynne's.  I have not heard from Hyundai since.  Truthfully, my wife and I are very happy with our Sonata, EXCEPT for the issue of the peeling paint.  All of our friends comment on its ugly appearance.  Sincerely, Joel E Lipkin

Apparently, even though my antenna is working fine Hyundai requires you to replace the entire system and does not make the shark fin cover available.  I explained that I thought the cost was prohibitive and was looking for some options.  The customer service agent appeared somewhat nonchalant regarding this issue and after pressing she did suggest I go to the dealership for a diagnostic and to see if there was anything they could do.  I have made an appointment in hopes of speaking to the service manager but based on my interaction with customer care I do not have high hopes.

I got on the Puente Hills Hyundai website and got an appointment quite easily. I thought I would call the service department and find out how long it would take to do the service. I have to admit I was a bit frustrated as the phone kept ringing endlessly with no one picking up. I finally called again and got the operator who connected me with somebody in the service department who was able to answer my question. There was also a chat box on the website of which I raised the same question, but I was not able to get an answer. 

My wife and I like the car and I hope that our service appointment goes well tomorrow. I plan on waiting for the car as the service person on the phone told me it would be 2 to 3 hours.

My enquiry was asking why the gas engine on my Santa Fe PHEV came on when I had plenty of electric power left in the battery, was not accelerating hard, was not climbing a steep hill, and was only driving at low speeds. The customer care representative, who I assume was your Margaret, suggested I take the vehicle into a dealer for, and I quote   ---"" Our factory trained technicians will be able to inspect and diagnose your vehicle to determine why the gas engine starts running unnecessarily when you have put your vehicle in electric mode"".  I took the vehicle and spoke to a technician who was unable to give me an answer to my query but that he would research the issue and would get back to me when I take the vehicle in for its first service in approx. 3000 miles. The technician is a very interested guy by the name of Jeff, and he is at Riverside California Hyundai.  On the journey home from meeting with him, a trip of 8.6 miles the gas engine ran for approx. 3.6 miles or 42% of the journey. I started that journey with 7 miles of electricity reserve and ended it with 2 miles left. At no time did I accelerate hard or exceed 45 mph. There were no hard hill climbs. Clearly something is not right. Hopefully Jeff will resolve the issue when I take the vehicle for its first service in a few month's time.  When I met with Jeff I asked about another concern I have about the ""Current Trip"" recorder. Surely a trip is defined as the journey from start to finish i.e. when one reaches the final destination. My current trip recorder resets to zero every time I stop the vehicle. For example on 19-May I drove from Santa Nella California to my home in Riverside. That trip was very approximately 340 miles. We stopped several times for bathroom breaks, breakfast and just resting. Every time we stopped the recorder reset to zero.  Hence other than writing the stats down every time I stopped, and using a calculator, I have no way of knowing the distance or gas consumption for that total trip. This is absurd.  How do I switch to manual control of my trip stats. Again, I left this concern with Jeff until my first service.  These are the reasons why my scores are so low. Incidentally I bought my new Santa Fe a couple of months ago. It is my first Hyundai. I cannot in all honesty say, at least for now, that I am likely to recommend the Hyundai brand to a friend or colleague"".

I could get in and if I left a message they returned my call. Foundations is where I purchased my car from BECAUSE it's so close it made maintenance, and maintaining the warranty, easy. The last time I needed to take my Tucson in because it malfunctioned it took TWO months for them to see me. It wasn't an oil change or maintenance MY CAR WOULDN'T EXCELLERATE. In my opinion it was a safety concern... 
I had been trying to schedule an oil change on my car for the last 2 months. When I called and spoke to Lydia, I let her know the problems I've been having and she suggested I go to another dealership. The closed one other than Foundations is twice the distance away. I realize this is not her fault but I felt that she blew off my concerns about needing to get my service done and not being able to go elsewhere without forgoing the warranty. LUCKILY Steve with Stevenson Hyundai in Longmont got me in same day, he was honest about the service being covered vs. when it will not be covered, and the best part was they got me in and out in less than 2 hours which is 1/2 the time Foundations took.

I reached out to their designated representative for paint warranty claims, Indy Tong, in 1/24.  While I recognize that at just about that time, she went out on maternity leave, I left voice messages that went unreturned.  I sent an email with pictures of my vehicle-no response.  In late January I started calling every few weeks.  No one got back to me.  I must have called at least five times with no one willing to help me.  Finally when I threatened to show up at the dealership and create a scene in front of other customers, I FINALLY got a call back.  I was advised that Cornelius Hyundai didn't have a body shop, and that I would get my warranty claim addressed much quicker if I called a dealership that had a body shop, and I was provided with two suggestions in the Charlotte NC area.  The first dealership I called, Modern Hyundai in Concord, NC, advised me that they DO NOT have a body shop.  So I called Keffer Hyundai in Charlotte and they were extremely helpful and courteous.

I explained that I just came back from my local dealer who told me there were none within a 500 mile radius.

Efraim said he would ask his supervisor then came back telling me his  supervisor said Hyundai doesn’t make any RWD vehicles. I explained again that the car was electric. So Efraim went back to his supervisor who said I should go to a dealer to ask them to check. I reminded Efraim I had just came from a dealer which was the reason I contacted customer service in the first place. Overall Efraim didn’t pay attention to what the customer asking and his supervisor needs training to understand Hyundai does indeed manufacture RWD cars.  - It would be nice to be able to take advantage of the promotion, however it’s only on RWD vehicles which Hyundai doesn’t appear to ship to the northeast.

The only reason I gave a 6 to the last question, ""Would I recommend Hyundai to a friend or colleague"", is due to having major issues with my car and being told (at the dealer) we have to have information collected regarding major oil consumption (in which I have had to routinely check and add oil every 1 1/2 to 2 weeks, and report to the Service Department as well as take my car into the shop so they could see (and record) for themselves and send the PA report to the Corporate Office.  I was told this was being done only to find out that was not the case (but that's not Gianni fault).
I love my Sonata and have taken very good care of it. I have done everything I was requested to do regarding the issue with my car.  I have no problems with the dealership in Meridian MS where I purchased my car. It just angers me that I was mislead for over a year, and now I'm told the process will have to be totally redone.  Again, Gianni was more help with the issue and gave me a ""case number"" which I do not have with me at the time of this survey.

When I purchased the vehicle, I was told I would get one 30 min charge per day at no cost to me for 3 years.  It’s only been 2 years and Electrify America is stating that Hyundai changed it to only 2 years.  After calling Hyundai I was told that was for the new sales, but I should still receive 3 years.  In order to fix that, I needed to call a different number and also send in pictures of my charge to receive compensation for being charged in error.  I find the constant passing the buck of Hyundai to be very frustrating.   Why do I have to go through so much and spend my valuable time to fix your error?  This is not the first time I have had this issue with Hyundai.  Car has been good, but the customer service has been very subpar.  The lack of ability for any of the representatives to be able to take control and resolve a problem is disappointing.  All they do is talk to you and refer you somewhere else.  You never speak to anyone that can actually resolve your issue.  Now I have to find time to fill out this form and call into another number and probably get passed to someone else…again.

After waiting 3 hours I inquired about how much longer it would be, and I was then informed that they had not even started working on my car yet because they only have 4 technicians . I got so upset that no one thought to mention how behind they were and he did not care that I was already waiting there for 3 hours! I asked for my keys and car back and left without getting any service completed nor did I receive any apology for their unprofessional conduct. They wasted my time and did not care enough to offer any information or update while I was there waiting. I have never had any issues at my previous service appointments.  I was so furious that I did not want to reschedule another service appointment . 
I expected better treatment from the Millennium Hyundai service staff   as a Hyundai customer who had a scheduled appointment and I’m now  very discouraged from doing any future business with this Hyundai dealership.
I hope that changes will be implemented to improve the customer service in this service department.

The local dealer said they were not sure but probably economy mode and no regeneration braking for the Interstate. I wanted to know if I could count on getting 200 miles on a full charge as there are a couple of spots where it is almost 200 miles between fast chargers. Their best answer was to try it before taking the trip by going the 200 miles where there were fast chargers available at less than 200 miles if needed so I guess it is more up to me that getting information from Hyundai USA or my local dealer. Possibly one of the reasons why a lot of people are reluctant to get into a electric vehicle. Really like the IONIC 6 SEL otherwise. I am wanting to use only rear wheel drive on the trip and having the front wheel motor turned off. Don't know if I can do that and no one was sure if it could be done.

CA232,44581,Roseville Hyundai,Mary Murphy,05/30/2024,n/a,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"We had a terrible experience buying our THIRD Hyundai at Roseville Hyundai. The dealership refused to help us so I reached out to you, but you referred me back to the dealership, who essentially told us they didn't care and wouldn't help us. This is our 4th Hyundai (my first was purchased as a college student) and we've ALWAYS been pleased, but this time the sales team took advantage of my husband, who has Parkinson's, and didn't provide the car he thought he'd agreed to.

I got a recall on my 2008 Hyundai Santa Fe and took it to Northwest Hyundai 19300 Northwest freeway in Jersey Village Tx. 
I left the car there and they had to order parts . I picked the car back up and it took a month to get the parts in. So I took it back to this dealer to get the recall fixed. Aaron Jackson call and told me that the belt tensioner was froze up. I told him that I just put a brand new alternator on it and it worked find.
He also quoted me $1200 to put a new one on. I said NO it was find I’ll do it if it needs it just fix the recall.
He also said the diagnose cost would be $243. I said it’s a recall it’s already been diagnosed.
He tried to scam me out of $1200. plus.
After my son called him and told him you can’t charge that because it’s on recall already.
After some time on the phone he told my son that it want be no charge. Then when I got it home the new alternator had a piece broken off of it and my oil dip stick was tape up with electrical tape.
Would not replace a $28 part.
I have tried numerous times to get ahold of Michael Turner he also promised to call me before noon.
Never heard back from him.
I tried calling him and it seems he’s not available. Not a good supervisor and Aaron is a lair and a scammer. I’ll never recommend this place to anyone.
Certified mechanic??  Really?

The recall #188 was a fuse issue that was changed out earlier. 
The problem I am having is with my ABS system. I lost all brakes with NO ABS warning light. 
The dealership says it’s my ABS acurator. With the cost of this part and installation my car is a total loss!
How can a safety system like that fail in such a horrible way and NOT give a warning? This was a great car my mother in law sold me before she died so it has sentimental value, but not at this price. 
This has left a bad taste for a good company.

My colleague and close friend went out and bought a Hyundai based off of my recommendation and my mother and father both own one as well. But after the treatment I received at the El Cajon Hyundai I don’t even want to own a Hyundai any more. The pearl white paint is peeling on my vehicle and after seeing many white Hyundais on the road with this same problem, I decided to look into it. I found that there has been a recall on this paint but just not on my cars year. After speaking the service representative she told me Hyundai will look into replacing the paint out of goodwill although she ended up sending me to a shop that wouldn’t even take the photos of the car for me. (El Cajon Hyundai) The service representatives at this shop told me from the start they were unable to take the photos because they cannot do the actual body shop repairs at that location. I even called this location specifically before heading 45miles there and they said they’d take the photos so I was very unsatisfied with their performance. Then they said a different Hyundai can do it but when I asked if they can make me an appointment there they said no. I wasted my gas and my time and I really hope someone can help make this better for me.

She was exceptional and to me the example of how excellent customer service should be delivered. She was patient to discover and explore the depth and breadth of the issues, reviewing several prior notes regarding the issue, then trying to address the issues within her power then reaching out to those who might be better able to, then even providing additional options to further  seek resolution. She was professional and left me feeling she did every last thing she could have within her power to help me. I felt heard, respected and that my issue was of importance to the company.

 I'm increasingly disappointed with the remote connectivity feature in the Hyundai vehicles. While like that you are ahead of the curb, the remote connectivity feature continues to be a sore point for me and it is something I bought the cars to use and was really counting on using it in all my cars, to then go on to buy several more Hyundai vehicles, to take further advantage of this. I was planning to purchase another Hyundai car this weekend and currently is at a pause until I am sure that I can count on the software working for my business needs. For my 2013 Elantra GT the vehicle no longer qualifies for Blue Link, my 2016 Tucson though it qualifies for blue link, I am unable to sign up for the feature as it is saying the software needs updating even though I updated to the latest software available on the owners website and followed the instructions on the site to do so for this purpose. My 2019 Sonata was a breeze to setup  but unlike my other cars that take advantage of the TuroGo feature on the Turo platform that I rent my cars through, the car is not coming up with that option though it is compatible with the platform for this  option and after i purchased the annual plan.

But fulfilling orders is a Hyundai issue, and maybe I was looking for at least an acknowledgement or apology that the system isn't working as good as it might right now.

The ability of Hyundai customer care to provide a resolution was exceptionally disappointing. My vehicle is outside of warranty by mileage. I had a failure of a non-component on a vehicle that is two years old. The air conditioning evaporator has no bearing on the mileage of the vehicle, and the Goodwell process failed to resolve the issue. Sadly, now I am left with an expensive repair bill on a defective component. It’s sad to see that that Hyundai would not step up and offer a resolution or any type of participation. I was told that once the Goodwill request was denied there is no available appeal or ability to speak with someone that did not say no. this is my second Hyundai and I find it very difficult to consider another one in the future at this time.

Hyundai has not handled this recall in an organized and timely manner.
