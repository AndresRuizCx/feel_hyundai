The only reason I gave a 6 to the last question, ""Would I recommend Hyundai to a friend or colleague"", is due to having major issues with my car and being told (at the dealer) we have to have information collected regarding major oil consumption (in which I have had to routinely check and add oil every 1 1/2 to 2 weeks, and report to the Service Department as well as take my car into the shop so they could see (and record) for themselves and send the PA report to the Corporate Office.  I was told this was being done only to find out that was not the case (but that's not Gianni fault).
I love my Sonata and have taken very good care of it. I have done everything I was requested to do regarding the issue with my car.  I have no problems with the dealership in Meridian MS where I purchased my car. It just angers me that I was mislead for over a year, and now I'm told the process will have to be totally redone.  Again, Gianni was more help with the issue and gave me a ""case number"" which I do not have with me at the time of this survey.

In 2021, it was determined by the dealer that the engine was failing and the cylinders were scored allowing oil to seep into the cylinders. I was the second owner of the vehicle having purchased it as a certified vehicle AND I purchased the extended warranty coverage as well. All maintenance was done on the vehicle according to Hyundai recommendations. Every time I brought it in for service, I was told it was. It bad enough to replace the engine. Now it is burning oil at the rate of 1 qt per 1000 miles. (Totally Unacceptable). Now my extended warranty has run out and Hyundai says they can’t do anything because I am not the original owner.

After waiting 3 hours I inquired about how much longer it would be, and I was then informed that they had not even started working on my car yet because they only have 4 technicians . I got so upset that no one thought to mention how behind they were and he did not care that I was already waiting there for 3 hours! I asked for my keys and car back and left without getting any service completed nor did I receive any apology for their unprofessional conduct. They wasted my time and did not care enough to offer any information or update while I was there waiting. I have never had any issues at my previous service appointments.  I was so furious that I did not want to reschedule another service appointment . 
I expected better treatment from the Millennium Hyundai service staff   as a Hyundai customer who had a scheduled appointment and I’m now  very discouraged from doing any future business with this Hyundai dealership.
I hope that changes will be implemented to improve the customer service in this service department.

The local dealer said they were not sure but probably economy mode and no regeneration braking for the Interstate. I wanted to know if I could count on getting 200 miles on a full charge as there are a couple of spots where it is almost 200 miles between fast chargers. Their best answer was to try it before taking the trip by going the 200 miles where there were fast chargers available at less than 200 miles if needed so I guess it is more up to me that getting information from Hyundai USA or my local dealer. Possibly one of the reasons why a lot of people are reluctant to get into a electric vehicle. Really like the IONIC 6 SEL otherwise. I am wanting to use only rear wheel drive on the trip and having the front wheel motor turned off. Don't know if I can do that and no one was sure if it could be done.

I got a recall on my 2008 Hyundai Santa Fe and took it to Northwest Hyundai 19300 Northwest freeway in Jersey Village Tx. 
I left the car there and they had to order parts . I picked the car back up and it took a month to get the parts in. So I took it back to this dealer to get the recall fixed. Aaron Jackson call and told me that the belt tensioner was froze up. I told him that I just put a brand new alternator on it and it worked find.
He also quoted me $1200 to put a new one on. I said NO it was find I’ll do it if it needs it just fix the recall.
He also said the diagnose cost would be $243. I said it’s a recall it’s already been diagnosed.
He tried to scam me out of $1200. plus.
After my son called him and told him you can’t charge that because it’s on recall already.
After some time on the phone he told my son that it want be no charge. Then when I got it home the new alternator had a piece broken off of it and my oil dip stick was tape up with electrical tape.
Would not replace a $28 part.
I have tried numerous times to get ahold of Michael Turner he also promised to call me before noon.
Never heard back from him.
I tried calling him and it seems he’s not available. Not a good supervisor and Aaron is a lair and a scammer. I’ll never recommend this place to anyone.
Certified mechanic??  Really?

My colleague and close friend went out and bought a Hyundai based off of my recommendation and my mother and father both own one as well. But after the treatment I received at the El Cajon Hyundai I don’t even want to own a Hyundai any more. The pearl white paint is peeling on my vehicle and after seeing many white Hyundais on the road with this same problem, I decided to look into it. I found that there has been a recall on this paint but just not on my cars year. After speaking the service representative she told me Hyundai will look into replacing the paint out of goodwill although she ended up sending me to a shop that wouldn’t even take the photos of the car for me. (El Cajon Hyundai) The service representatives at this shop told me from the start they were unable to take the photos because they cannot do the actual body shop repairs at that location. I even called this location specifically before heading 45miles there and they said they’d take the photos so I was very unsatisfied with their performance. Then they said a different Hyundai can do it but when I asked if they can make me an appointment there they said no. I wasted my gas and my time and I really hope someone can help make this better for me.

She was exceptional and to me the example of how excellent customer service should be delivered. She was patient to discover and explore the depth and breadth of the issues, reviewing several prior notes regarding the issue, then trying to address the issues within her power then reaching out to those who might be better able to, then even providing additional options to further  seek resolution. She was professional and left me feeling she did every last thing she could have within her power to help me. I felt heard, respected and that my issue was of importance to the company.

 I'm increasingly disappointed with the remote connectivity feature in the Hyundai vehicles. While like that you are ahead of the curb, the remote connectivity feature continues to be a sore point for me and it is something I bought the cars to use and was really counting on using it in all my cars, to then go on to buy several more Hyundai vehicles, to take further advantage of this. I was planning to purchase another Hyundai car this weekend and currently is at a pause until I am sure that I can count on the software working for my business needs. For my 2013 Elantra GT the vehicle no longer qualifies for Blue Link, my 2016 Tucson though it qualifies for blue link, I am unable to sign up for the feature as it is saying the software needs updating even though I updated to the latest software available on the owners website and followed the instructions on the site to do so for this purpose. My 2019 Sonata was a breeze to setup  but unlike my other cars that take advantage of the TuroGo feature on the Turo platform that I rent my cars through, the car is not coming up with that option though it is compatible with the platform for this  option and after i purchased the annual plan.  These have left me a little frustrated.",35714970,"","",05/31/2024,05/31/2024,05/31/2024,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,30727269,,Andrew,Lyttle,,andrewlyttle22@gmail.com,,,,,,,2019,Hyundai,Sonata,5NPE34AF5KH769445,71.206.38.74,4823,,71.206.38.74,'Chrome 125.0.0.0','Windows 10',23339708,CA,2024/05/26 21:35:09,2024/05/29 08:53:48,MyHyundai,Secondary Owner,Siebel Administrator,HCCC Email,30727269,32388827,6949226,,CASSANDRA.LOPEZ,,,,Y,CHANGE OF MYHYUNDAI OWNERSHIP; 2019 SONATA.,CASE CLOSED UNTIL REQUESTED DOCUMENTS RECEIVED. ,CASSANDRA,

The ability of Hyundai customer care to provide a resolution was exceptionally disappointing. My vehicle is outside of warranty by mileage. I had a failure of a non-component on a vehicle that is two years old. The air conditioning evaporator has no bearing on the mileage of the vehicle, and the Goodwell process failed to resolve the issue. Sadly, now I am left with an expensive repair bill on a defective component. It’s sad to see that that Hyundai would not step up and offer a resolution or any type of participation. I was told that once the Goodwill request was denied there is no available appeal or ability to speak with someone that did not say no. this is my second Hyundai and I find it very difficult to consider another one in the future at this time.

CA033,44572,Manly Hyundai,Stacey Carney,06/03/2024,n/a,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,,"On 5/17/24, I set-up an appointment to get my Hyundai Accent serviced to fix Recall 251 at Manly Hyundai in Santa Rosa, CA. I made the appointment through the Manly Hyundai website and specified the recall that needed to be fixed; the appointment date was set for 5/30 at 9am. That same day (5/17) I called the Manly offices and was unable to reach a representative after calling 3 different times, but left a message asking for someone to call me back and let me know if the appointment I had just made would need to be rescheduled due to missing parts. I had a recall service a year or so back and showed up to the offices only to be told that the part wasn’t in stock and I needed to come back at another time. I was hoping to avoid this same issue happening again. I never received a call back and assumed my appointment was valid and should be kept. 

Today, I showed up for my appointment and was told that the part necessary to fix Recall 251 was not in stock at Manly Hyundai and that I needed to come back another day. This was highly frustrating since: 1) I had preemptively called the offices and asked someone to let me know if this was the case and never received a call and 2) I had made the appointment nearly 2 weeks in advance and had to specify the recall I was making the appointment for and no one followed up with me to cancel the appointment. My husband and I rearranged our mornings so that I had a ride home today, and this was all for nothing. I am confused as to why there isn’t someone reviewing the recall appointments that are made and checking that parts are ready for the appointments in advance. It seems like it should be a standard process in place so that customers aren’t wasting their time or the representatives’ time. 

I hope that this complaint reaches someone who can improve your internal processes as they relate to recalls and appointments made to fix them. I’m not sure if this issue is isolated to the Manly Hyundai store or not, but it’s happened twice to me now at this same store and is highly frustrating.

Unfortunately, they sent me to a dealership that only does oil changes on the weekends so I got up at 6 AM for nothing. I rescheduled an appointment for June 10, which does not help my issue whatsoever.

It would’ve been much more ideal if the customer service representative Knew that the appointment she made was only for oil changes, when she was fully aware my issue was related to maintenance and low oil pressure.

Very frustrating way to spend my Saturday morning when battling maintenance issues with my car and two young children.

Laurie was kind and helpful over the phone, however they plan of action was beyond incorrect for what I needed.

I cannot remember his name but once my car was finished he asked if I would like a wash and a vaccum. I declined the wash as I am having issues with my front bumper and did not want the car wash to pull it out even further. Once I was brought to my car after it was ready the gentleman told me that he had given it a car wash despite me telling him multiple times not to. I noticed after driving away that he also threw away some of my personal items during the vacuum. Overall I am not satisfied with the service I received. If a customer asks you not to do something then please don’t do it!! I called to let the manager know and he was “unavailable” so I was told to leave a message and he would get back to me. He never did. Called again and left a message for a different manager and was told again they would get back to me. No one ever did. I also had an issue with my hood not opening after the recall anti-theft was done on my car. I called multiple times afterwards and no one picked up the phone.
