Now for the bad news.  We will NEVER do business with the Hyundai dealership in San Antonio close to the IKEA!  I believe it was at 12908 I-35 Access Rd.  We had made an appointment weeks (more like months) ago for the recall notice for our front windshield and trailer hitch.  I called two or three days before the appointment to confirm but when we got their they weren't able to do the work.  It wasn't so much that, as it was the lies, stories and ATTITUDE the two service reps gave us didn't add up.  I argued their points but it was clear we weren't going to get the work done.  So, rather than making a ""Karen"", we rescheduled the appointment for the following week.  I didn't show it in front of the two reps but when I got into our car, I was FUMING!  A couple of days later, I called another dealership in New Braunfels (485 I-35) to better educate myself on the process of the windshield  recall.  The woman I spoke with painted a completely different picture.  I rescheduled my appointment with their service department and cancelled the appointment with the San Antonio location.  I welcome speaking with someone about this and I can be reached at 760-613-9005.

,,,Marie Nickerson,04/30/2024,n/a,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,,"I assume this person is NOT at my local dealership, but at Hyundai Customer Service.  I was having trouble with Blue Link.  I was trying to extend my service but couldn't get past the spinning cursor.  This kept happening...  I called my local dealership and was told to bring my phone in and talk to the sales staff; they apparently know how to use the app.  Well, I know how to use it too, and I was on a PC.  I am 1/2 hour away and was NOT happy with the response.  I asked if there's another way to get into my account, and the answer was ""no"".  I could not believe that, so I kept digging until I found a phone number and actually got a human!  I was so excited when someone alive answered.   She was ALSO unable to get past my spinning cursor in the account, and immediately stepped up the problem to her supervisor, who graciously expedited my order, gave me a great discount, and took my payment over the phone which was followed up by an email confirming the continuation of Blue Link service.  Both of the ladies I spoke to at Hyundai were awesome and went way above expected level of service.  My local Hyundai dealership, however, was totally incorrect, (there IS a phone number!) and seemed quick to brush me off.  This is the third time I've felt ignored or like a nutjob at this dealership.  I have had issues with the purchasing department, and now with service.  My tires still bounce on some turns and they told me the ""noise"" I hear is something rattling in the car because I have ""quite a bit of stuff in it.""  WHATTTT????  Don't most SUVs have ""stuff"" in them?  I know what a bouncing tire sounds and feels like, and one rear tire was 10lbs low last week.  I'm sure the car's diagnostics history will confirm that.  Eventually, since there's NOTHING WRONG with the vehicle, I'll have the tires replaced, but it WON'T be at the dealership!  Contrary to how it probable appears, I am NOT a criticizer, but I worked in Customer Service for many, many years, and I feel I am PAYING for care.

After requesting communication through email or text due to having problems being understood speaking the request was ignored. Unfortunately I received a email expressing my request was denied and I am required to speak with a representative. And without speaking to a representative the Bluelink would not be available to me. I have more than adequately  shared all documentation requested to verify ownership. My request was for assistance setting Bluelink on my phone. Simple to do as I am receiving messages when my door isn’t locked or if the battery may be low. I requested to complete setting up the Bluelink using email or text. My request has been rejected by the Hyundai customer service. Apparently it appears the representative didn’t think I deserved to have my request granted but would rather have me humiliated with my fumbles talking. As I communicated in the reply to the email sent, I clearly stated I prefer email or text messaging to finish recovering Bluelink . Although Bluelink is offered with the purchase of my 2023 Hyundai Santa Cruz I am being denied the this benefit because I am not comfortable with speaking skills expected. Margaret decided rather than understanding and providing alternative solutions for my situation she decided that I would have to speak to a representative at the expense of my dignity. I am again providing the information requested although without company logo. Hyundai, you have failed me.

I purchased my Santa-Fe Ultimate Limited in 2015 ""new"" and paid a plenty for it.  We have been very pleased with the car 
 and planned to look at another one when we decided to trade.   However, after 151,000 miles I'm told by the dealer that the car's engine is damaged and will require over $6K to repair.  They said it had low oil that caused the damage. 

A year or so ago I had the car in the shop for a oil issue that showed up almost overnight and paid over $600 to have it repaired.  They told me it was a bad oil sensor unit.  Now almost a year later a very similar problem occurs and I'm told it will cost over $6K to repair.  How would you feel if you bought a car like this and only got 151K miles out of it and being told by Hyundai they would offer no help.  I think we both know the answer. I think you also know where I plan to buy my new car.

I have called Bud Cleary Hyundai in Auburn WA over 6 times in a week and have left messages that indicated my check engine light was on, and as of now, no one has returned my call.  Other dealerships have told me it could take up to 2 months to get in and told me that I just need to drive with the engine light on until I can get my car in.  When I called customer service to report this, all they said they could do is make an online appointment for me in 2 months or more.  While she was sympathetic I was told that I would either have to drive with the check engine light on or rent a car for the 2 months+ that it would take to get my car in.  If Hyundai determined that the cause was under warranty, they would refund me for the rental car after the fact.  I asked for a written document stating that Hyundai was telling me to drive my car with the check engine light on, and she assured me that she was taking detailed notes and would send me a PDF of the report once it was done.  All I received from her was an email with a case number in the subject line and her initials in the body of the email, there were no attachments or embedded documents.

,,,Allan Spreen,05/03/2024,n/a,3,4,4,2,1,3,6,,"I am a LONG-time Hyundai customer. Over the past two decades, I've owned 6 Hyundais: 3 Sonatas and 3 Elantras, including 2 hybrids. This is purely constructive criticism, and I feel compelled to give it...
My latest vehicle is a 2024 Elantra Hybrid, trading in my previous 2022 Sonata (for minor reasons). After just a short period, I'd like to tell someone what I've discovered:
1. The mileage is excellent (though the tank causes slightly less range than my Sonata).
2. The performance is thoroughly adequate.
3. The key fob is beyond belief: over twice the size of Hyundai's other key fob, looks like an Easter egg that Goofy sat on, and the really ridiculous finding is that it doesn't even hold the emergency key! So, the emergency key must now be carried extra (not to mention that the silly plastic cover for the key has long since fallen off and disappeared).
4. The built-in GPS software is basically useless: for almost any trip, it picks a longer route than my cellphone, so now I must hardwire my phone to the vehicle, and use its GPS system.
5. There's only a single USB port to reach the on-board computer. Since it must now be employed to use my phone's GPS, I can't use it for any additional media input (thumbdrive, etc.)...there really should have been 2 outlets (I've since found that NO sort of splitter will work for this purpose).
6. My Sonata (Blue) had an overhead handle on the driver's side, while my upgraded Elantra has only a cut-out area for one, but no handle...Seriously, guys, would it have been that expensive to go ahead and throw the handle in there, like in the cheaper models?
Minor irritations, to be sure, but on a day-to-day basis they take some fun out of owning a new car. Since they are not difficult to address, hopefully the input may be worth something toward future vehicle designs.

,,,Charles George,05/06/2024,n/a,2,4,5,2,1,1,3,,"Also I’m a bit unhappy about the procedural difficulty in transferring ownership to me because it’s my understanding that this vehicle while previously sold developed difficulties with the cooling system and that Hyundai chose to take the vehicle back, provide previous owner with a different vehicle and then do a factory level repair then release the vehicle for resale as if new with full warrantee.  It seems to me the previous owner data should have been wiped and car sold as if new so that my purchase and attempts to register as new owner were the same as any other new buyer.   I attempted to get local dealer assistance with this process it was unsuccessful.  Using the website (not the app which went no where) I managed to begin this process more as if I’d purchased from a private sale than purchased through legitimate professional dealership.  This problem should be resolved in the preparation for professional resale steps rather than expecting a new (and unfamiliar) buyer to solve the supply chain communication difficulties to obtain the advertised benefits of “My Hyundai” and “Blue link” sevices.

,,,Caroline Capps,05/11/2024,n/a,1,1,1,1,1,2,7,,"I loved my 2012 Hyundai Accent, but I traded it in last December (in part because of the fire hazard recall that has yet to be resolved). I contacted Hyundai USA on 4/10/24, requesting that I be removed from all national and dealer mailing lists. I received a reply addressed to someone other than me (although I know the car has yet to be resold). I followed the directions in the email for removing my car from your system. I then received an email thanking me for REGISTERING my vehicle. I called today (5/11/24) and spoke with a representative who informed me that I must contact the DMV and my original dealer if I want to be stop receiving mailings. The DMV??? Really??? The DMV knew that I no longer owned the card in DECEMBER. I will contact my original dealer and request that I be removed from their mailing list. I find that my experience with Customer Care was unsatisfactory--from the automated menu selections to the ultimate inability to resolve this problem. Moreover, this feedback form asked me to rate someone named Mason, and I have never had any contact with said Mason. (I therefore had no choice in rating Mason, so please don't hold the ratings against him) I did not need Customer Care during the 12 years I owned my Accent, and this experience made me grateful for that.

Secondly I also asked to replace a headlight and fog light that were out and that was not done.

,,,Gloria Martin,05/11/2024,n/a,4,5,5,4,1,4,10,,"Customer Service has always been great in the past. When I reached out a few days ago, my experience was pretty good. The representative was very nice and professional and courteous towards me, but in general inquiry was not answered in the way I would like for it to be. I had received an email that my recall was ready in general, but the lady had informed me just not for my make or model for my Hyundai. So that was overall disappointing. I say that because it’s been months since I’ve been waiting for a solution for the recall and when it says it’s ready; it’s really not. When I asked her what happens otherwise and she says car fires within structures, etc. And that doesn’t sound very safe to me because I park at a car garage for when I have three appointments per week and I normally park in a garage in my house to protect my car from outside elements. So I was not very happy to hear about this and how it could impact me at a higher risk because of how I should park. I mean, I guess I could park out on the street when I’m at home I rather not but I will for safety wise. But when I have my appointments. I have no choice but to park in a car garage because there is no street parking.  in general was just disappointed that there was solution and I hope to get the letter soon.

Both times it took over 10 days for our car to be repaired. Both times it took over a week to get the loaner that we were promised. So, twice we were out a car for more than a week. When we call to get answers/check in, we are met with silence (no response) or we are told they will contact us by a certain day/time and then they don’t. We were not provided with the information that we needed to know in order to have the repairs made how they needed to be under warranty. We know that there is a process and timeline for things to happen, but we felt that AGAIN, the communication we got was not only poor but unacceptable.

When they would leave a message they wouldn’t say what it is about. So I would call and spend many minutes holding just to be told that they are working on the issue. Really?

Also, My electrify america 3rd year free charging issue where I was not given a 3rd year free charging as a result of paying to reserve my Ionic when purchased was NEVER RESOLVED. I spent MONTHS on the phone and emailing with Hyundai, Electrify America, and Brannan Hyundai Dealership without any assistance.

The local Hyundai dealer informed me they could not perform the extremely serious first action without also doing the latter action. I asked Brittney if that was an absolute requirement, as I was still researching the advisability of the proposed method of corrosion treatment (cavity wax in semi-enclosed areas of an eleven year old vehicle), and didn't want to delay preventing a fire. 
Brittney thoroughly researched the situation and replied that unfortunately, company policy required performance of both actions to do either one. However, she was also able to confirm that if I had a corrosion treatment done by a third party and submitted it to the Hyundai dealer for compliance  inspection, they could then perform the 251 recall action.

The Service Manager (Joe) and Customer Care Representative Halie took very good care of me and got me out in 1 day.  They also took care of the recalls on my Palisades.  The customer waiting area and lounge was spotless and very inviting.  I felt like a VIP.  I have nothing but good things to say about Killeen Hyundai.  My only other experience with a Hyundai dealership concerning maintenance was when I made an appointment with Round Rock Hyundai 2 years ago and it took 5 hours for them to do a free oil change.  Needless to say, I did not go back for my other two free oil changes.   While I have been very satisfied with the performance of my Hyundai Palisades, I have not been impressed with the amount of hassle involved with any maintenance/repair work necessary at the local dealerships.  The Service Manager at the Killeen Hyundai said that he was servicing cars from Dallas, Austin, San Antonio and now Hutto, where I live.  Makes me have to think twice about buying another Hyundai, if it is going to be this big a hassle to get one repaired/maintenanced  at a dealership.",35551145,Low Score 2 & 3 Star Response,"",05/11/2024,05/15/2024,05/15/2024,,,,false,false,,,,,,n/a,22022322,,Gordon,Vansickle,,vansickles55@austin.rr.com,,,,,,,2021,Hyundai,Palisade,KM8R7DHE6MU254347,38.186.106.211,2cdc,,38.186.106.211,'Chrome 124.0.0.0','Windows 10',23252266,CA,2024/05/09 10:02:10,2024/05/09 10:18:34,Campaign,223 Seat Belt Pretensioner,HCCC General,HCCC General,22022322,23650714,4136866,32402,KRYSTAL.JONES,,,,Y,RECALL 233 INQUIRY,appointment scheduled,KRYSTAL,

I cannot believe that for the rest of the time that I own my 2015 Hyundai Elantra, I am going to have to continuously be fearful of someone trying to take it. I regret ever getting the software update because it did absolutely nothing to benefit me. My insurance doesn’t cover a rental unless my car is PHYSICALLY stolen, so what am I supposed to do when someone smashes my window and ruins the steering wheel? You’d think Hyundai would offer a FREE rental car to customers who are impacted by this, but that must be asking WAY too much of a company who KNOWINGLY sold these defective cars!!! It’s absolutely unbelievable. I am out thousands of dollars because of this company. Now Hyundai is saying there’s another recall on my car, and there is not yet a solution. So in the meantime, don’t park in the garage. Are you kidding me?? I NEED to park in my garage to keep my car safe from attempted theft!!! Unless I want to fork over THOUSANDS of dollars yet again? What a customer experience this has been… and then Hyundai won’t even give me a steering wheel lock because I’m no longer eligible due to receiving the software update. At least my local police department has enough sense to hand them out for free, thank goodness I was able to get one from them. Finally someone who LISTENS. Hyundai says they’ve “done their part” (that’s a quote directly from your representative) by giving me the free software update. Like I said, I absolutely regret getting that update because it has done nothing but screw me over. The thieves can have that piece of crap car for all I care. Then at least I’d get a free rental from my insurance AND God willing if it’s missing long enough, an insurance payout so I can buy a different vehicle that’s NOT a Hyundai and then and only then will my issue be resolved. Until then, this car has become my ball and chain. Thank you for the absolute worst customer experiences I’ve ever had in my life. Anytime someone is considering a Hyundai I tell them to stay away.

BTW, the same engine that was clean and NOT in need of that until something went wrong with the cars engine … which again, was of no fault of my own. This repair cost around $500 … a drop in the bucket for Hyundai … not so much for me!!! Not only would your customer care team not help me …. Because of your very strict rule not to make exceptions for things not under warranty … you wanted ME to ask my dealer to request a special “service assistance” from Hyundai, which I did. This just REEKS of poor customer support and exceptionally poor logic on Hyundais part. If the car YOU made, functioned properly, I wouldn’t have to go through this mess. Am I happy? NO!! If you want to have good PR, you should listen to your customers and provide financial support despite your illogical rule. Again, you made the car and it’s engine. You accept blame and responsibility for the problem and yet you want me to pay to clean up your mess … literally!!!

It has been going on for several years and after following Corporate's instructions, I still don't have an answer to whether or not Hyundai is going to do the right thing and take care of the problem.  When I purchased this vehicle, I was charged extra because this was a ""custom paint"".  I would have been better off with a traditional paint, as they have not had the problem that this paint has had.  After having them cancel two appointments, I took my car to Lynne's Hyundai in Bloomfield, NJ, more that an hour from where I live, on March 4th.  I was told it would take about a week before I heard from Corporate after seeing the pictures of my car that were taken at Lynne's.  I have not heard from Hyundai since.  Truthfully, my wife and I are very happy with our Sonata, EXCEPT for the issue of the peeling paint.  All of our friends comment on its ugly appearance.  Sincerely, Joel E Lipkin

I had a few questions after having my car serviced at my local dealership, for that recent service campaign re cylinder head cover oil leak.

The cover flew off the car while I was driving.  I called the local dealership about the cover and was told the part was not sold separately and that I would have to pay $1100.00.  Apparently, even though my antenna is working fine Hyundai requires you to replace the entire system and does not make the shark fin cover available.  I explained that I thought the cost was prohibitive and was looking for some options.  The customer service agent appeared somewhat nonchalant regarding this issue and after pressing she did suggest I go to the dealership for a diagnostic and to see if there was anything they could do.  I have made an appointment in hopes of speaking to the service manager but based on my interaction with customer care I do not have high hopes.  Since the fin coming off is not an unusual problem, based on my research, Hyundai definitely needs to address this.  I will continue to hound this situation until I can find an acceptable solution.

However,  I was very disappointed to find out that Hyundai's Complimentary Maintenance service is only good for four oil changes and for my vehicle, the oil is to be changed every 8000 miles, that means the 36,000 miles that is advertised as complimentary is incorrect and deceptive advertising. I was told by the service advisor that I was bringing the car in too soon for servicing and as a result of that, Ive reached the limit for the complimentary oil change.

I was simply referred to call local dealership to get estimate for repair at my own cost!...no option for resolution by Hyundai...the paint on the front of my vehicle randomly bubbled and fell off a few months ago...I have photos...I have seen this same issue on several other Hyundai Sante fes same model, same color and I believe same model year and believe it is a defective paint issue that should be addressed by Hyundai.  I would appreciate a response to this concern.  Thank you.
